RAMList is a section of the CTCL website dedicated to listing the components, specifically the DRAM ICs, that computer memory modules use.

Note: Lists that do not focus on memory module such as mobile devices and storage devices may not be updated as often as they are not the original focus of RAMList. 

## Why?

CTCL's RAMList was originally made to continue the memory module list (RAM List) at ramlist.i4memory.com that seemed to become unavailable some time in 2016.

Knowing specifically the memory ICs contained on a memory module or system may help with:

- Overclocking 
- Recycling electronic components for use in other systems
- Computer component collections
- Research

## Glossary

### Data sizes
RAMList always differeniates between bits and bytes. This is only for RAM devices and not for storage.

- GByte = 1073741824 Bytes
- Gbit = 1073741824 Bits
- MByte = 1048576 Bytes
- Mbit = 1048576 Bits
- KByte = 1024 Bytes
- Kbits = 1024 Bits

### Clock rate
Hertz is a meaure of frequency

- GHz = 1000000000 Hertz (Hz)
- MHz = 1000000 Hertz (Hz)
- KHz = 1000 Hertz (Hz)

### Rank Count

RAMList follows the common scheme of describing the amount of ranks and bit-widths of the module. Sometimes, the amount of ICs (integrated circuits) are specified. 

For example:

- 1Rx8 - One rank, 8 bits per IC
- 2Rx8 - Two ranks, 8 bits per IC
- 2Rx4 - Two ranks, 4 bits per IC

### Timings

RAMList follows this order when describing memory timings, unless specified.

**CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS-CR**

- CL - CAS (Column Address Strobe) Latency
- tRCD - RAS to CAS delay
- tRP - Row Precharge Time
- tRAS - Row Active Time
- CR - Command Rate

### Company name special cases 

#### Hynix/SK hynix

In 2001, Hyundai Group split, forming Hynix Electronics
In 2012, Hynix was acquired by SK group, changing the company name to SK hynix.

- SDRAM: Hynix/Hyundai Electronics
- DDR, DDR2, SGRAM, LPDDR, LPDDR2: Hynix
- DDR3, GDDR5: Hynix/SK hynix
- DDR4, DDR5, GDDR6, LPDDR3, LPDDR4(X), LPDDR5: SK hynix

#### Infineon/Qimonda

In 1999, Siemens spun-off Infineon Technologies for semiconductor production
In 2006, Infineon Technologies spun-off Qimonda for computer memory production

For conistency, RAMList would use this rule with specific memory generations:

- Older than SDRAM: Siemens
- SDRAM, DDR, DDR2: Infineon/Qimonda
- DDR3: Qimonda

With the acquistion of Cypress Semiconductor in 2019, Infineon Technologies started producing certain DRAM types for embedded devices:

- HyperRAM: Infineon

#### Brand Names

Some memory companies may have brand names or separate companies (subsidiaries). These would be treated as "IC Brand" and the company producing the IC would be used as the "IC Die Vendor".

Micron Technology:

- SpecTek
- Crucial

Qimonda/Infineon:

- Aeneon

Nanya Technology (Formosa Plastics Group):

- elixir

Powerchip:

- MIRA/Deutron (separate company, founded by the same founder)
- Zentel

## Legal and Accuracy

### Overclocking info
RAMList purposely does not include information on what ICs perform "better" in overclocking than others as the focus of RAMList is identification.

### Component Changes
Vendors may change components; use different ICs from time to time. A listed module could use different components from what is shown on RAMList.

If this is the case, please [contact me](https://crazyblockstech.com/) for additions and/or changes.

### Original Research
Content added with the source being "CrazyblocksTechnologies Computer Labs", "CTCL", etc. is classified as original research. I strive to show as much information as possible while being accurate. If more information is needed, such as photo proof, please [contact me](https://crazyblockstech.com/contact/). This is also the case with "Kris", who is an online friend, usually I have pictures of the described module/component when adding such entries.
