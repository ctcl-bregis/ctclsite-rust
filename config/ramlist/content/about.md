RAMList is a section of the CTCL website dedicated to listing the components, specifically the DRAM ICs, that computer memory modules use.
## Why?

CTCL's RAMList was originally made to continue the memory module list (RAM List) at ramlist.i4memory.com that seemed to become unavailable some time in 2016. In August 2023, the format of the content switched from a list of modules and devices to more of a guide. The former list format commonly ended up being misleading.

Knowing specifically the memory ICs contained on a memory module or system may help with:

- Overclocking
- Recycling electronic components for use in other systems
- Computer component collections
- Research

## Glossary

### Data sizes
RAMList always differeniates between bits and bytes. This is only for RAM devices and not for storage.

- TiByte, TiB = 1099511627776 Bytes
- Tibit, Tib = 1099511627776 Bits
- GiByte, GiB = 1073741824 Bytes
- Gibit, Gib = 1073741824 Bits
- MiByte, MiB = 1048576 Bytes
- Mibit, Mib = 1048576 Bits
- KiByte, KiB = 1024 Bytes
- Kibits, Kib = 1024 Bits

### Clock rate
Hertz is a meaure of frequency

- GHz = 1000000000 Hertz (Hz)
- MHz = 1000000 Hertz (Hz)
- KHz = 1000 Hertz (Hz)

## Legal and Accuracy

### Overclocking info
RAMList purposely does not include information on what ICs perform "better" in overclocking than others as the focus of RAMList is identification.

### Component Changes
Vendors may change components; use different ICs from time to time. A listed module could use different components from what is shown on RAMList.

If this is the case, please [contact me](https://crazyblockstech.com/) for additions and/or changes.

### Original Research
Content added with the source being "CTCL", etc. is classified as original research. I strive to show as much information as possible while being accurate. If more information is needed, such as photo proof, please [contact me](https://ctcl-tech.com/contact/). This is also the case with "Kris", who is an online friend, usually I have pictures of the described module/component when adding such entries.
