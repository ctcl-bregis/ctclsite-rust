Due to the extended downtime of my server systems (including the router and DNS server), I was limited with what I could work on for a while. 

Fixes/changes:

- Fixed entry of my G.Skill elixir kit, specifically having "Nanya" and "elixir" in the wrong fields


To-Do:

- Change incorrect use of "MHz" to "MT/s" and convert PCx-xxxxx to "MT/s"
- Add DDR4 entries from Hardwareluxx (including "B-die Finder") and i4memory RAM List
- Check for new DDR5 kit releases
- Add DSL (Data Specialties) DDR3 and DDR4
- G.Skill serial number info from http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?283666-Figuring-out-G-Skill-s-SNs
- Some of my memory modules
