Major performance imporovement on server-side processing with the version 2.1 of the CTCL website. RAMList pages should now see a 10x faster server-side processing time. This was done by using the CSV (Comma-separated values) format instead of YAML for device entries. For reading into Python dictionaries, the Python CSV library performs significantly faster than YAML. CSV also appears to be more suitable for the table-like content of RAMList. The amount of data received by the browser from this change should be the same.

Other fixes:

- Fixed "Hynix/Hynix/SK hynix" ...again
- Fixed missing speed info on DDR2 and DDR3

Additions:

- Added user contributed module to DDR4
