Additions:

- Some DDR5 modules from TechPowerUp
- Various DDR2 modules from TechPowerUp
- User contributed module

Changes:

- Fix typos on DDR5
- Add die revision on SK hynix DDR5 if it was not there before
- Changed PC2-style speed grades to DDR2-style, how this was done may effect the name of modules in which I would need to correct manually.
- Added another source for the Neo Forza NMUD416E82-4600CG20 DDR4-4600 kit that did have the original chip markings
