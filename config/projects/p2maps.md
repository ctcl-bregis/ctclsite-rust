Since January 2022, I dabbled in the creation of maps for games utilizing Valve's Source game engine, originally Half-Life 2 but now Portal 2. Working with the Source game engine has taught me a lot about game design and lead to me establishing friendships.

# Published Maps

## Laser Router
The first map I made for Portal 2 is called ["Laser Router"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3068699712) and was released on November 16, 2023. The map was also my first published map that was made using Valve's included Hammer software. The style of the map was of the original Portal from 2007 as I prefer this aesthetic over Portal 2's aesthetic. As this was my first ever map, the puzzle was not that great and the map had multiple flaws.

## Laser Router 2
With valuable feedback, I begun working on the successor called "Laser Router 2". This map has significant improvements over Laser Router with more test elements and secrets.

This map has more of a non-linear approach, the player can either get the redirection cubes to the main test chamber first or activate the laser (Thermal Discouragement Beam) with the energy ball first.

This map was publicly released on January 1, 2024 while it was originally published for playtesting on December 22, 2023. It can be found ["here"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3120435680).

## Companion Shield
On December 15, 2023, I made a concept map named ["Companion Shield"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114962594) that took me up to 30 minutes to design in the in-game Puzzle Maker editor. It demonstrates the idea of shielding the player from turrets by using a cube while using the cube to solve the puzzle.

# In Progress

## The Hall
On December 23, 2023, I started developing a map completely in Hammer with the working title "The Hall". Unlike my past maps, this map is much more personal. It takes inspiration from a hallway in a school that I have not seen since early 2011 so this part of the map is completely designed from how I remember it. Because of being based off such a faint memory, the map takes on a Liminal Spaces aesthetic. This my first map with custom designed textures, specifically posters.
