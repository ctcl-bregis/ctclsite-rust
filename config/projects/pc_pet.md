"Polyethylene Terephthalate" (shorthand "PET") is a desktop system that I put together in late 2021. It served as the "main" desktop for all of 2022. It had a variety of workloads such as running PC games, virtualization, EDA and running the Xactimate estimating software.

## Legacy
All computer-bound work I have completed surrounding Fort Myers Beach island was done on this system.

In January 2023, the successor "Polybutylene Terephthalate" was built, replacing "Polyethylene Terephthalate" as my "main" desktop PC.

On June 1, 2023, the system was permanently decomissioned after discovering that the motherboard damaged eight memory modules for unknown reasons. 

During 2023, I started the plan for ["Polyethylene Terephthalate v2"](../pc_pet2), a redo of "Polyethylene Terephthalate".
