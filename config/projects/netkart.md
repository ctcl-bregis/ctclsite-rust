The NetKart Automotive Network project, codenamed "Umbreon", is a project surrounding the upgrades and the addition of a computer network to an off-road go-kart.

# Phases
The project is split into multiple "phases", each one focusing on a certain part of the go-kart.

## Phase 1
Phase 1 covered getting the vehicle to a safe, drivable state, the phase was completed on March 7, 2021. Phase 2 surrounds general repairs then upgrades to the transmission and braking.

## Phase 2
Phase 2 surrounds general repairs then upgrades to the transmission and braking. This phase was officially started on March 7, 2023.

### Engine
The engine has undergone some modification during this phase, namely with the removal of the engine governor. The exhaust system is also planned to be upgraded significantly with the addition of a stock Harley Davidson muffler with an included catalytic converter.

The engine also gets an electric start upgrade. With the addition of an electric start adding a battery, there is the plan to add lighting including tail lights with functional signalling and a light bar.

For sound and vibration dampening, the engine would be isolated with rubber mounts. 

### Transmission
The centrifugal clutch and many of the chain driven parts of the transmission would be replaced with a CVT (continuously variable transmission) kit.

Along with the addition of a CVT, a gearbox for shifting into reverse, neutral and drive will be added. 

### Frame
The frame will also go under significant modification. For extra strength and rigidity, the frame will be welded together as the frame was held together with nuts and bolts.

## Phase 3
Phase 3 is when I actually start adding the computer network. The plans for specifically the dashboard computer system is loosely based off the MCU platform used in Tesla electric vehicles, such as the plan to use an AMD Ryzen processor.
