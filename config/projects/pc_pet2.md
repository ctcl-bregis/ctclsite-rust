"Polyethylene Terephthalate v2" (shorthand "PETv2") is a planned desktop build directly based off ["Polyethylene Terephthalate"](../pc_pet). It retains the white and purple theme of the previous build.

## Configuration
The following is subject to change

Planned configuration:

- Motherboard: Supermicro X9DAi
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2667 v2
- Memory: 64GB (8x8GB) Qimonda IMHH8GP22A1F2C-10F DDR3-1066 4Rx4 Registered ECC (Prod. in Dresden, Germany)
- Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT XFX THICC II Pro 8GB GDDR6 (Samsung)
- Storage: **TBD**
- Power Supply: Super Flower Leadex III ARGB 850W or equivalent
- CPU Coolers: **TBD**
- Case Fans: **TBD**
- Case: **TBD**

A planned feature of the desktop is to have cooling fans mounted over the memory modules due to the immense amount of heat that the early dual-die package DRAM devices produce under load.
