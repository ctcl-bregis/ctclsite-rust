nonmonolithic was a project to showcase photos either taken by me or my father.

# History and Inspiration
Almost all photos are a result of insurance-related work where documentating building damage is a crucial part of the work. This documentation of damage throughout buildings ends up leaving thousands and thousands of photos, many of them fit the classic "The Backrooms" and liminal spaces aesthetic.

My original idea to share these photos started in May 2020 under the Instagram account named @weird__hole__. I later discontinued the project in November 2020 for unknown reasons.

I picked the project back up in late July 2023 starting with a video relating to the game Half-Life 2, attempting to start an ARG (Alternate Reality Game). Not too long after, I switched back to the original idea of using photos of real places to gain interest as these videos took a lot of effort to make.

I often used photos that I have taken, these photos are often better as they were intended to be used for liminal spaces posts unlike ones used for the job.

On November 9, 2023, an event occured that resulted in me discontinuing the use of Instagram. This resulted in the project being put on hold, indefinitely. On December 8, 2023, I decided to keep the @nonmonolithic account on Instagram and the related Discord account for historical purposes. 

On January 15, 2024, along with the creation of this page, I added a Story post on Instagram linking to this page as it describes the future of the project.

# Name 
The name "nonmonolithic" was chosen in relation to the layout of many modern AMD x86-64 processors. A non-monolithic layout of a processor means that there are multiple silicon dies within a single package, CPU. AMD uses this for the Ryzen (some) and EPYC series of processors. As part of the theme, almost all content was edited and posted from ["Polybutylene Terephthalate"](../pc_pbt/).

The profile picture that I used for the longest time on Instagram, later Discord was of a screenshot of the Half-Life 2 map d2_coast_09 with the AMD logo drawn on a wall made in Garry's Mod.

# Caption and Post Guide
The following is a guide to the meaning behind each post

There are two lines: first, the caption that may be a pun or something else related to the image. The second is the information about the picture. 

The second line is added for authenticity; if every picture is taken by me or someone I know, I would know what camera was used and the date of the picture. Most services such as Reddit, Discord and Instagram strips the EXIF metadata from the picture during the posting process for security and privacy purposes. If I used content posted on such services, I would not know the camera model and date for every picture.

As an extra precaution, all identifying metadata is stripped from the image manually before it is posted online.

For authenticity, the device along with its motherboard, CPU implementer and CPU architecture are listed with each post.

`Authored: <device codename, linked to motherboard> (<vendor and motherboard/system model>, <CPU implementer and architecture>)`
