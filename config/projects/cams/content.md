CAMS Asset Management System, or just CAMS, is a fully custom inventory management software made for mainly organizing computer hardware. I have been working on the idea since late 2021. The project currently uses the Python programming language.

The source code is currently hosted through GitHub at this [repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/cams/).
