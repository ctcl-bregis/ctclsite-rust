CAMS Asset Management System, or just CAMS, is a fully custom inventory management software made for mainly organizing computer hardware. I have started to learn how to write Python to start working on the project in late 2021. The idea was from created the need of a specialized asset/inventory management system software to organize the vast amount of computers and computer parts that I had.

CAMS is based off the fully custom-made inventory management software, commonly referred to as just "IMS", used by the computer resale company 2nd Life Inc. of Richmond, Virginia where I was employed formerly. Unlike CAMS, 2nd Life IMS was written using Ruby on Rails. The development of CAMS is also inspired by the inventory software [PartKeepr](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr).

Formerly CAMS meant Computer Asset Management System but now CAMS referrs to CAMS Asset Managment System since the software can be used to manage other types of assets if configured so.

# Development
The original codename for CAMS when Python was going to be used is "Rainbow Trout". The current plan with Rust uses the codename "

Originally, CAMS was planned to be written in Python using the Django web framework. In March 2024, since no actual development has been done for CAMS yet, I decided to switch to Rust for the project as I have already moved to Rust for [ToDoKiosk](../todokiosk/) and [the website](../ctclsite/).

# Planning
CAMS is anticipated to be the largest software project that I would work on by myself. The project suffered from the lack of project management and and the lack of planning.
