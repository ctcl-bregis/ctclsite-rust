CAMS, currently known as 'CAMS Asset Management System' is an asset management software that I have planned to develop since 2021. 

It is based off from the custom inventory management software used by 2nd Life Inc. that I got to use first-hand during my employment there. It is unique in the way that it each asset; a single item, is assigned an unique ID.

# Development
CAMS was the main motivation to start learning programming in Python.

## Python
Since 2021, I have made many attempts to start working on CAMS but I never got far due to my limited knowledge of programming.

As described in the "Rust" section below, plans to write the software in Python was dropped in March 2024 in favor of Rust. On April 1, 2024, the repository for CAMS was renamed to "cams-rust" as there was barely any Python code left.

The codename for the Python version of CAMS was "Rainbow Trout", starting the [Trout theme for Python web software](../codenames/).

## Rust
In February 2024, I have started to move to Rust for all web software development. There was the idea to write CAMS in Rust in early 2023 but I never got to it. I plan to start development of CAMS once I have a better understanding of Rust after the completion of the Rust versions of ContactList and SLAG which both use databases.

With the successes of rewriting [the website](../ctclsite/), [ToDoKiosk](../todokiosk/) and [ContactList](../contactlist/) in Rust using the Actix Web framework, I have decided to write CAMS in Rust once the time comes.

The codename for the Rust version of CAMS is "Red Rock Crab" and was chosen in early 2023.
