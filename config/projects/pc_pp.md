"Polypropylene" is an experimental desktop system for testing the use of AMD Opteron processors in a desktop environment. The sytem was built after I was given an ASUS KCMA-D8 motherboard at 2nd Life Inc.

The device later became a "meme" build, resulting in the change of my Steam username to "IDSH1G-02A1F1C-13H" and the change of my profile picture to a edited picture of one of the ICs on the memory modules listed below. The joke was about the ICs being produced near Richmond, Virginia while the location on my Steam profile was of Richmond, Virginia. I unintentionally extended the joke with how my account appeared when I played through the game ['Micron'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/290380/Micron/), referencing the Inotera joint venture. The username and profile picture was changed to match my profiles on other platforms on January 1, 2024.

On January 24, 2024, the codename for the device was changed from "Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene" to "Polypropylene" due to ABS plastic in reality being made up of multiple monomers which does not follow the codename guide.
