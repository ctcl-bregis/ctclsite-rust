# Introduction

"Polymethylmethacrylate" (shorthand "PMMA") is the codename given to the HP ZBook Studio G3 laptop with an Intel Xeon processor that I acquired in September 2021. Its main purpose is to serve as a mobile workstation for cases where a desktop system such as ["Polybutylene Terephthalate"](../pc_pbt/) is not efficient to transport such as on airlines and most overnight trips. Its use of ECC memory and an Intel Xeon mobile workstation processor makes it a rarity but important for mission-critical applications.

# Configuration

Configuration as of January 8, 2024:

- System: HP ZBook Studio G3 15
- CPU: Intel Xeon E5-1505M v5
- Memory: 1x16GB 2Rx8 DDR4-2400 (at DDR4-2133) Unbuffered ECC SODIMM SK hynix HMA82GS7AFR9N-UH
- GPU: Nvidia Quadro 1000M 2GB GDDR5 (SK hynix)
- Storage: 500GB NVMe SSD SK hynix Gold P31
- Display: 15" 1920x1080 IPS LCD Samsung

The system currently dual-boots both Linux Mint and Windows 10 Professional.

The SK hynix Gold P31 was chosen specifically for its [low-power operation being shown in benchmarks and its use of LPDDR4 memory for cache](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sk-hynix-gold-p31-m2-nvme-ssd-review/2), which makes the SSD better suited for mobile applications such as laptops.
