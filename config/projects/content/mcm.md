MediaCow Micro is a series of projects that I imagined in July 2021. It is a challenge of coming up with 26 different portable audio player device designs throughout my lifetime.

Each design is named in alphabetical order, from MediaCow Micro A to MediaCow Micro Z. There is no order that these devices are developed as I may work on device designs with more common microcontrollers first.

Due to lack of funding, a project would be considered "finished" when the PCB design is finalized instead of having the project finished when there is a working, physical prototype.
