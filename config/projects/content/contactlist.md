ContactList is a configurable contact manager web software made in the need of a simple and private contact management system. 

# Development
Development of ContactList was started in early June 2023 and its first release was on June 16, 2023, during the return trip to Fort Myers Beach, Florida. 

## Python
At first, ContactList was developed using the Python programming language with the Django framework. The Python version has the codename "Brown Trout". By April 2024, the Python version is no longer in development.

The source code for the Python version of ContactList is hosted on GitHub: [contactlist-python](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/contactlist-python/)
## Rust
On March 22, 2024, I started to rewrite ContactList in Rust using the Actix Web framework.
