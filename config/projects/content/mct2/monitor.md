An optional part of the project is a separate device called MonitorCow. MonitorCow is basically an external monitor with the theme of MediaCow Touch 2. 

## Features
MonitorCow is intended to be easily to disassemble in order to swap parts such as the LCD panel. The internal connection for the LCD panel would be Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) which most modern laptops use.

### Connectivity
Like many external monitors, the main interface is a USB Type-C port with DisplayPort alternate mode.

A feature unique to MonitorCow is that it has connectors for HDMI and VGA for connecting devices that do not have USB Type-C DisplayPort.
 
## Hardware

### Case
The case may be made from white PET(G) like MediaCow Touch 2. 

### PCB
Instead of having the complex task of designing another PCB for use in the monitor, an off-the-shelf controller board may be used.

### Display
To match the DPI and screen size of MediaCow Touch 2, the display chosen would be 11.6" diagonal and have a resolution of 1920x1080. 

For the initial prototype, an N116HSE variant or equivalent with mounting brackets would be used.
