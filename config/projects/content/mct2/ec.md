## Introduction
To keep things more simple, I would make use of the popular STMicroelectronics STM32 series.

Until July 30, 2024, I planned to use two microcontrollers named "SMEC" and "PMEC" for System Management and Power Management respectively, respectively. Now, I plan to use just one microcontroller. 

## Microcontroller Selection
As of July 30, 2024, STMicroelctronics lists 3,989 microcontrollers available
