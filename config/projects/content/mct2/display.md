The display is one of the most important parts of the device. 

## Display Selection
I eventually used the 11.6" 1920x1080 eDP touchscreen from DFRobot that has been tested for use with the LattePanda Mu specifically. I preferred to use an Innolux AAS IPS LCD in the device though using the touchscreen from DFRobot was, by far, the easiest and least expensive option. 

When I tested the display with the LattePanda Mu, the display appeared better than I expected and would be well suitable for use in the project.
