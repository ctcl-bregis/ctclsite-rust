The display is one of the most important parts of the device. 

## Display Selection
I eventually used the 11.6" 1920x1080 eDP touchscreen from DFRobot that has been tested for use with the LattePanda Mu specifically. I originally avoided using the display due to the high chance that the LCD panel was manufactured by BOE where BOE IPS LCDs has caused eye strain from my experience and instead I wanted to use an LCD panel from Innolux. 

When I tested the display with the LattePanda Mu, the display appeared better than I expected and would be well suitable for use in the project.
