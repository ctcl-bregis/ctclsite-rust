The display is one of the most important parts of the device. 

## Display Selection
I eventually used the 11.6" 1920x1080 eDP touchscreen from DFRobot that has been tested for use with the LattePanda Mu specifically. The DFRobot-provided touchscreen was, by far, the easiest and least expensive option for an 11.6" display. In the beginning of the project during June 2024, I have made extensive research on putting an Innolux AAS IPS LCD panel in the device though this option was neither inexpensive or easy.

When I tested the display with the LattePanda Mu, the display appeared better than I expected and would be well suitable for use in the project.
