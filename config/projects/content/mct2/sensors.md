## Temperature

### Inlet Temperature Sensor
The inlet temperature sensor measures the temperature of air entering the system cooling fan. It can be used to determine ambient temperature.

### SoC Temperatures
The temperatures of the CPU and GPU dies of the SoC are read from the integrated temperature sensors of the N100.

## Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope
A combined 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit is used to provide the functions of a Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope. These functions are provided by a TDK InvenSense ICM-20948.

## Barometric Pressure
A Bosch BMP384 is used to measure atmospheric pressure.
