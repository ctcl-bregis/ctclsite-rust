MediaCow Touch 2 would make use of M.2 NVMe format SSDs like many laptops.

## NVMe
Despite the small amount of board area to work with, there is still support for SSDs with sizes up to 2280 along with there being mounting holes for 2230, 2242, 2260 drives. This would allow for a larger variety of SSDs to be used, including higher performance ones.

The SSD would use the most amount of PCIe lanes with four going to the connector. This would allow for the device to use PCIe 3.0 NVMe drives to their full capabilities. In contrast, the M.2 Key M slots on both the Full and Lite carrier boards provided by LattePanda/DFRobot just have one PCIe lane connected to the slot. 

## eMMC
In production, the 64GB eMMC on the LattePanda Mu may be left unused.
