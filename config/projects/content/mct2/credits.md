## Software Used

### CAD and EDA

#### KiCAD
KiCAD played a crucial role in the circuit design phase; the hardest and most complex task in the project.

#### LibreCAD
LibreCAD was used for the first time on August 6 to record measurements of the battery pack that is used in the device.

#### OpenSCAD and FreeCAD
OpenSCAD was used for the design of the case. The design was going to be done in FreeCAD but soon after I switched to OpenSCAD to complete the case design.

### Planning and Documentation

#### draw.io/diagrams.net
The desktop version of draw.io was used extensively for planning the physical layout of the device.

#### Git and GitHub
The MediaCow Touch 2 hardware design and software files are hosted on GitHub for anyone to see while having the ability to easily sync progress across devices in cases where I have to go somewhere.

#### ctclsite-rust
This website hosts this documentation while being a convenient method to showcase my ideas, progress and thought processes. 

#### Discord
Using a chat service in as a way to dump ideas into categories has returned from MediaCow Touch 1 where I used a self-hosted Rocket.Chat instance for that purpose. This time I used a private "server" on Discord to dump and brainstorm ideas. At the conclusion of the project, I would make a public release of the idea dump channels. 

#### MediaWiki
A self-hosted MediaWiki instance is used for personal documentation. It's role in MediaCow Touch 2, however, is very limited. 

### Software Development
This software was used to develop software for the project.

#### VSCodium
VSCodium is used as the main editor for any software project, including this website. Content like these pages are written using VSCodium.

The 'Open Remote - SSH' extension played a crucial role during development as it let me edit files on the desktop PC from anywhwere like I am using VSCodium on that system.

90+% of development was done in Midlothian, Virginia.

## People 
The project's codename and a major part of the theme is based off from L'Hommeblanc of Paris, France who I knew online since October 2020. He had this role in the project since its original planning stages in early 2021.

This project was made possible by LattePanda where hardware and documentation was provided.
