## Software Used
Open Source software has been used whenever possible. 

### CAD and EDA

#### KiCAD
KiCAD played a crucial role in the circuit design phase; the hardest and most complex task in the project.

#### LibreCAD
LibreCAD was used for the first time on August 6 to record measurements of the battery pack that is used in the device.

#### OpenSCAD and FreeCAD
OpenSCAD was used for the design of the case. The design was going to be done in FreeCAD but soon after I switched to OpenSCAD to complete the case design.

### Planning and Documentation

#### draw.io/diagrams.net
The desktop version of draw.io was used extensively for planning the physical layout of the device.

#### Git and GitHub
The MediaCow Touch 2 hardware design and software files are hosted on GitHub for anyone to see while having the ability to easily sync progress across devices in cases where I have to go somewhere.

#### ctclsite-rust
This website hosts this documentation while being a convenient method to showcase my ideas, progress and thought processes. 

#### Discord
Using a chat service in as a way to dump ideas into categories has returned from MediaCow Touch 1 where I used a self-hosted Rocket.Chat instance for that purpose. This time I used a private "server" on Discord to dump and brainstorm ideas. At the conclusion of the project, I would make a public release of the channel logs. 

#### MediaWiki
A self-hosted MediaWiki instance is used for personal documentation. It's role in MediaCow Touch 2, however, is very limited. 

#### STM32CubeMX
STM32CubeMX was used to select the microcontroller used as the embedded controller (SMEC) and plan its pinout.

#### CircuitJS
[CircuitJS](https://falstad.com/circuit/) has been used to test ideas such as using Schottky diodes on the power inputs of SPI flash memory and connecting the IS pin of the Infineon BTS7006 to a microcontroller.

### Software Development
This software was used to develop software for the project.

#### VSCodium
VSCodium is used as the main editor for any software project, including this website. Content like these pages are written using VSCodium.

The 'Open Remote - SSH' extension played a crucial role during development as it let me edit files on the desktop PC from anywhwere like I am using VSCodium on that system.

## Locations

MediaCow Touch 2 was developed in the following locations:

- Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, United States
- Bramwell, West Virginia, United States
- Fort Myers Beach, Florida, United States
- Fort Myers, Florida, United States
- Midlothian, Virginia, United States - Including:
  - Brightpoint Community College Midlothian Eliades and Trailblazer buildings
- Orlando, Florida, United States
- Pocahontas, West Virginia, United States

90+% of development was done in Midlothian, Virginia. 

This list excludes any work done from aircraft, which was an Airbus A320 for both the departing and return flights from Orlando, Florida during the August 2024 trip to the Fort Myers Beach area.

## Individuals and Organizations 
The project's codename and a major part of the theme is based off from L'Hommeblanc of Paris, France who I knew online since October 2020. He had this role in the project since its original planning stages in early 2021.

This project was made possible by LattePanda where hardware and documentation was provided.
