Since I have gotten a Flipper Zero, I have planned to customize the firmware for my own use while still being compatible with the mobile app and most existing apps.

The goal with this custom firmware is to have the device less like a toy and more of a multitool.



## Features

- No Dolphin leveling, animations, butthurtedness, etc.

Unlike some custom firmware forks, this firmware does not "unlock" the transmit frequency bands.
