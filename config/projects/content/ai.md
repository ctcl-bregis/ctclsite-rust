At the beginning of the 2020s, generative AI usage has taken off and many are making use of it.

## Policy

### How it is used
When I make use of generative AI, computation must be done on my own hardware; locally hosted.

### What it is used in

#### Creative Work
I **do not** use generative AI in the creation of creative work, especially for photography projects such as ['nonmonolithic'](../nonmono/).

#### Programming
I may make use of generative AI to *assist* in development of software. Output of AI prompts will be reviewed extensively and modified to fit coding styles if the output can even be used.
