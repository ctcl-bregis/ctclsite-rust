Since 2022, I have created fonts mainly for use on this website. 

All of these fonts were created for use on the website. When needed, these fonts may be converted to other formats for use in embedded devices. All of the fonts are licensed under the OFL and are available at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/pixel-fonts/tree/main).

In May 2024, I have came up with a Python script that converts Piskel sprites to SVG files called [piskelc2svg.py](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/script-dump/blob/main/converters/piskelc2svg.py). This significantly increases the development process of pixel fonts, making a potentially days long task into an hour long task. Before the script, I drew all of the boxes manually in FontForge which was slow and tedious.

Later, in June to July 2024, I came up with significantly more efficient ways to produce fonts using just FontForge and Python scripts. As of July 20, 2024, the fonts are generated by a script called "build.py" in the root of the repository.

In July 2024, I decided to go back to using fonts such as Play and Heuristica (used exclusively for MediaCow-related content) on the website. The pixel fonts' appeareance greatly depended on the pixel density of the display. The monitors on the system I use to develop the website is realitively low compared to a smartphone, at 96 DPI.
