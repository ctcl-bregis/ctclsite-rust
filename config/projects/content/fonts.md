Since 2022, I have created fonts mainly for use on this website. 

In May 2024, I have came up with a Python script that converts Piskel sprites to SVG files called [piskelc2svg.py](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/script-dump/blob/main/converters/piskelc2svg.py). This significantly increases the development process of pixel fonts, making a potentially days long task into an hour long task. Before the script, I drew all of the boxes manually in FontForge which was slow and tedious.

From May 22, 2024 to May 25, 2024, these fonts were created:

- Pixel-16x16
  - Condensed - 12x16, not fixed width
- Pixel-14x14 
  - Condensed - 10x14, not fixed width
- Pixel-12x12
  - Condensed - 8x12, not fixed width
- Pixel-9x9
  - Condensed - 5x9, not fixed width
- Pixel-7x7
  - Condensed - 5x7, not fixed width

All of these fonts were created for use on the website. When needed, these fonts may be converted to other formats for use in embedded devices. All of the fonts are licensed under the OFL and are available at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/pixel-fonts/tree/main).
