On August 29, 2024, an idea appeared for an expansion module for the Flipper Zero that effectively turns the device into [MathPad](../mathpad/).

The module is basically a keypad with standard Cherry MX-style keyswitches. A TCA8418 is used for key matrix scan and communicates with the Flipper through I2C. 

This is just an idea at the moment and I do not plan on starting development any time soon.
