The [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) is a small handheld device for exploring and pentesting various types of computer hardware. It was developed by the [Flipper Devices team](https://flipperdevices.com/) and a crowdfunding campaign for the device was started in 2020. 

In April 2024, I have begun to explore the development of custom modules that make use of the GPIO header on the device. As of April 18, 2024, I do not have a Flipper Zero yet so testing and development would have to be done using other microcontroller boards.
