## Introduction

Codenames are used to differentiate between projects and computer hardware.

The current codename system is used more or less as an inventory system until proper inventory management is set up with either [CAMS](../cams/) or something else. Codenames for specific devices may be retired or significantly less relied on once an inventory management system is put into place. Hardware design and software projects will continue to have codenames.

Throughout lists below, any codename that has a link and/or is in **bold** is currently in use or is assigned to a future device.

## Rules for codenames

- As of February 22, 2022, codenames shall no longer be *directly* related to real persons. Though the codename "Paris" will continue to be used by MediaCow Touch 2.
- Codenames should not be longer than 30 characters but with some exceptions when seen fit such as "polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride"

### Specific to embedded device project codenames

- Codenames for embedded device projects must have codenames of real places and not fictional ones. (e.g. Lakewood Plaza Turbo)

### Specific to workstation device codenames

- Codenames must not have symbols and numbers except for commas, dashes and numbers when they are needed to differeniate between codenames. An example of such exception is 3,7-Dimethylxanthine.
- Codenames are unique and are not reused, they are bound to the PCB (circuit board) that contains the main processor(s), such as a motherboard.
- Codenames stay linked to the motherboard even if the device's application changes such as the reuse of parts from a workstation in a server. An example of this is [Polyethylene](../pc_pe/).

## Workstation Codenames
Codenames given to specific systems are different from hardware project codenames as codenames for such projects are linked to the project idea itself and not a specific device/prototype.

Starting with "Polyethylene Terephthalate" in 2021, chemical compounds are used for any device codename.

With chemical compound names:
- The existence of a chemical compound must be verified
- Starting February 6, 2024, codenames relating to chiral chemical compounds must use the names of its optical rotations

Codenames do not differeniate devices on a network; they are not hostnames or part of hostnames. Hostnames are short descriptions of what purpose the device currently serves and are seen on the network by that name, such as "SVCS" for virtualization systems.

### Names to Use
Chemical compounds may have multiple ways to name their chemical structures. Generally, the most common chemical name for a substance is used.

Due to the length of many of the codenames, a shorthand version is given in this format: `<codename> - <shorthand codename>`

For example, with Serdexmethylphenidate, the IUPAC name `(2S)-3-hydroxy-2-[[1-[[(2R)-2-[(1R)-2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl]piperidine-1-carbonyl]oxymethyl]pyridin-1-ium-3-carbonyl]amino]propanoate` could not be used for a device codename for multiple reasons.

Another example, with lisdexamfetamine, the INN name is used over L-lysine-dextroamphetamine or lisdexamphetamine because the lisdexamfetamine name is more common.


### Chlorofluorocarbons and Hydrochlorofluorocarbon

Starting June 2, 2023, Chlorofluorocarbon and Hydrochlorofluorocarbon codenames are reserved for Intel systems without ECC memory support. This excludes devices originally classified as a Chromebook or Chromebox, as they may get a chromium compound codename. Intel systems with ECC memory support may get a plastics-related codename instead.

This scheme was originally started to poke fun at the potential environmental effects of Windows 11.

On January 19, 2024, the categories for Chlorofluorocarbons and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons were extended to include Chlorofluoroolefins and Hydrochlorofluoroolefins respectively.

#### Chlorofluorocarbons/Chlorofluoroolefins

### Polymers

Polymer-related codenames, specifically plastics, are reserved for workstations with ECC memory support. This along with started with **Polyethylene Terephthalate** in 2021 with inspiration by the plastic's use in textiles.

Uncategorized polymer codenames are for general use at the moment.

- [Polycarbonate](../pc_pc/) - PC
- **Polyoxybenzylmethyleneglycolanhydride** - Bakelite

#### Polyolefins and Polystyrene

Polyolefin codenames historically have been used with dual-socket systems and systems with high core count CPUs.

Currently, this includes any dual-socket AMD Opteron, dual-socket Intel Xeon and single-socket AMD EPYC systems. Dual-socket AMD EPYC systems may be assigned a polyvinyl codename instead.

- [Polyethylene - PE](../pc_pe/)
- Polyisobutylene - PIB
- Polymethylpentene - PMP
- [Polypropylene - PP](../pc_pp/) and **Polypropylene v2** - PPv2

#### Polyvinyls

Codenames of polymers made of monomers with a vinyl group are for future use with systems with multiple AMD EPYC processors.

- Polyvinyl Chloride - PVC

#### Vinyl Monomers

Though unrelated to the hardware in the "Polyvinyls" section above, codenames of monomers with a vinyl group are used for systems using VIA x86/x86-64 processors with or without ECC memory support regardless of application.

- [Vinyl Chloride](../srv_vc/) - VC

### Psychoactives

Codenames of psychoactive substances are generally used for server systems starting early 2023. All of these systems have ECC memory unless otherwise specififed. The use of names of psychoactive substances started with stimulants for the reason specified in the Stimulants section below.

#### Stimulants

Stimulant drug-related codenames are generally for use with virtualization and compute servers. The use of stimulants for codenames of compute servers is inspired by the use of stimulants for the treatment of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), the choice of codenames relate to this.

##### Amphetamines

HP ProLiant blade servers that were given to me on May 5, 2023 use the names of amphetamines or related prodrugs.

Starting September 5, 2023, codenames derived from amphetamine-based stimulant and related prodrug chemical compounds are now to be used with any HP BladeSystem-compatible device.

- [Dextroamphetamine](../srv_amp/) - "DXA"
- [Levoamphetamine](../srv_amp/) - "LVA"
- [Lisdexamfetamine](../srv_amp/) - "LDX"
- 4-Hydroxyamphetamine - "HXA"
- Levomethamphetamine - "LVMA"
- Dextromethamphetamine - "DXMA"

##### Methylphenidates

Stimulant codenames and related prodrugs in the methylphenidate family are reserved for future use with Supermicro AMD EPYC hardware. The codename "Serdexmethylphenidate" is expected to be the first one used due to personal importance. 

- Dexmethylphenidate - DMP
- Levomethylphenidate - LMP
- **Serdexmethylphenidate** - SDX

#### Hallucinogens

Codenames of hallucinogenic compounds are generally for use with non-embedded network router/gateway devices. This specific theme started with some server codenemaes being based off the 2010 Far East Movement single, "Like a G6".

##### Dissociatives

Codenames of dissociative compounds are for use with routers using Intel x86-64 processors.

- [Dextromethorphan](../srv_dxm/) - DXM

##### Psychedelics

Codenames of psychedelics that have an psychedelic effect are for use with routers using AMD x86-64 processors.

##### Deliriants

Codenames of deliriants are for use with routers using any ARM-based SoC.

#### Sedatives

Sedative drug-related compounds are generally for use with non-embedded storage servers.

- Alprazolam - AZM
- [Promethazine](../srv_pm/) - PM or PRM
- Diphenhydramine - DPH

#### Cannabinoids

Cannabinoids, due to their unique effect, are used for critical mobile devices instead of servers. Formerly, codenames derived from methylxanthines were used for mobile devices but that theme was later discontinued for multiple reasons, one of them being that methylxanthines are considered stimulants.

##### Phytocannabinoids
Codenames derived from phytocannabinoids, or naturally-occuring cannabinoids, are to be used with mobile devices that use SoCs or microprocessors.

- [Tetrahydrocannabinol](../pc_thc/) - THC
- Hexahydrocannabinol - HHC
- Tetrahydrocannabiphorol - THPC
- Hexahydrocannabiphorol - HHPC
- **Cannabidiol** - CBD 

##### Synthetic cannabinoids
Codenames derived from synthetic cannabinoids; cannabinoids that are not naturally-occuring, are to be used with mobile devices that use microcontrollers. This specific theme was defined for deciding a codename for a Flipper Zero device. 

- **Dimethylheptylpyran** - DMHP

### Thiols
Thiol-related codenames are reserved for AMD Ryzen systems without motherboard ECC memory support. AMD Ryzen systems with ECC memory support may get a plastics-related codename instead. This includes devices with customized AMD processors using the Zen series CPU architecture such as the Valve Steam Deck's APU and the APUs used in the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. Thiols that are used in the odorization of fuel gases are used first. 

Unlike the HCFC/CFC theme for Intel-based devices, codenames for these devices are chosen regardless to their form factor.

- Butanethiol - BTH
- Decanethiol - DTH
- Dodecanethiol - DDTH
- **Ethanethiol** - ETH
- Ethylhexanethiol - ETTH
- Hexadecanethiol - HDTH

- Propanethiol - PTH
- [tert-Butylthiol](../pc_tbm/) - TBM, TBTH
- tert-Dodecanethiol - TDDTH
- tert-Nonanethiol - TNTH
- Tetradecanethiol - TDTH
- Undecanethiol - UDTH

### Chromium-based Compounds

Chromium-based compound codenames are for use with systems originally designed for Chrome OS such as Chromebooks or Chromeboxes but had the firmware replaced with Coreboot or similar, allowing them to be designated a codename. The source of this codename scheme is fairly obvious. 

- Chromium Acetate - CrA
- **Chromium Chloride** - CrC
- Chromium Nitrate - CrN
- Chromium Oxide - CrO
- Chromium Phosphate - CrP
- **Chromium Sulfate** - CrS
- Ammonium Dichromate - CrD
- Calcium Chromate - CaC
- Chromium Trioxide - CrT
- Potassium Chromate - CrK
- Sodium Chromate - CrU
- Barium Chromate - CrB
- Lead Chromate - CrL
- Strontium Chromate - CrR

This codename scheme applies to both x86-64 and ARM systems that have had their firmware/BIOS replaced with Coreboot or similar.

### Development Hardware
Development hardware are systems used in the development of other hardware such as system on modules, single-board computers and evaluation kits. This codename scheme makes use of the names of hydrocarbons in relation to how they are used to "build" other chemical compounds. 

Codename schemes for development systems are chosen in relation to what CPU architecture they use instead of the other codename schemes that are based on application.

#### ARM Development Hardware
For ARM-based development systems using ARM applications processors currently use codenames of alkanes.

* Methane 
* Ethane
* Propane
* Butane
* Pentane
* Hexane
* Heptane
* Octane
* Nonane
* Decane

#### x86 Development Hardware
x86-based systems currently use the codenames of cycloalkanes. This would start with "Cyclobutane" for the LattePanda Mu used for MediaCow Touch 2.

- Cyclopropane
- **Cyclobutane**
- Cyclopentane
- Cyclohexane
- Cycloheptane
- Cyclooctane
- Cyclononane
- Cyclodecane
- Cycloundecane
- Cyclododecane
- Cyclotridecane
- Cyclotetradecane

### MIPS Development Hardware
MIPS development hardware uses codenames of alkylcycloalkanes.

### RISC-V Development Hardware
RISC-V development hardware uses codenames of polycycloalkanes.

### Special
Special chemical compound names are reserved for rare hardware platforms.

Devices that would have a "special" codename include but is obviously not limited to:

- Branded under:
  - Positivo, Positivo BGH (common in Latin America, especially Brazil, but rare in the US)
  - Micron Technology
- Contains a SoC from the following vendors:
  - Ingenic (only Jz series)
  - DM&P (e.g. Vortex86)
  - MagicEyes
  - Chips&Technologies
  - C-Cube Microsystems
  - Sunplus Technology/Generalplus Technology excluding development hardware (e.g. BPI-F2P/S, CTCL-designed hardware) and DVD video decoders
  - MCST (МЦСТ)

#### Antimatter
Antimatter codenames are for use with Positivo-branded hardware. This scheme started in late 2021 with the introduction of a Positivo Y210 tablet.

- **Positronium Hydride**

#### Ions

- Helium Hydride

## Embedded Project Codenames

Embedded circuit design projects are codenamed after specific locations such as cities, towns and villages. The design idea is what receives the codename, unlike the workstation codenames that are linked to a single unique motherboard.

Specific hardware units used in embedded hardware projects may receive a codename specific to it. For example, the LattePanda Mu received for the MediaCow Touch 2 "Paris" project was given the codename "Cyclobutane". CTCL-designed hardware can receive codenames such as if a mobile device not using an SoM; has the SoC on a custom PCB, it can receive a Cannabinoid codename as described in the sections above.

For a hardware project to receive a codename, the circuit design must have at least one microcontroller, microprocessor, System on Module or SoC on the PCB.

Exceptions to the requirement of the design requiring a processor of some sort are:
* MediaCow "Syracuse" (2019)
* MediaCow Touch "Nashville" (2020)

Codenames must contain just the name of the city, town, village or CDP. Codenames that are of different places with the same name cannot be used, for example: If a project codenamed "Richmond" after Richmond, Virginia already exists, another project cannot use a codename named after Richmond, California as both would be "Richmond". 

### By Chipset

#### SP7021
Starting May 16, 2024, any project using the Sunplus/Tibbo SP7021 SoC or any other Sunplus ARM implementation are to use codenames of locations in **Brazil** starting with "Curitiba" because of its personal value.

### MediaCow

MediaCow is a series of projects about the design and assembly of portable media players and tablet computers.

The first MediaCow in 2019 received the codename "Syracuse".

#### MediaCow Touch

MediaCow Touch devices have received codenames relating to real persons that I have met online. Codenames for these devices do not follow any theme. Though MediaCow Touch "Nashville" is considered to be codenamed after a real person, it is also inspired by the business trip in May 2020 to Nashville, Tennessee.

- [MediaCow Touch (1) - "Nashville"](../mct_1/)
- [MediaCow Touch 2 - "Paris"](../mct_2/)

#### MediaCow Touch Mini

Currently, there is no theme for codenames used for MediaCow Touch Mini devices. A lot of these device ideas would receive special codenames.

- MediaCow Touch Mini SP7021 - "Curitiba"

#### MediaCow Micro

Starting December 16, 2023, [MediaCow Micro](../mcm/) devices would use codenames of locations within Central New York State or nearby locations that were personally important in any way. This excludes any codenames under "Generally Reserved Codenames" such as Canastota, Oneida and Clay.

Potential codenames for these devices:

- Brewerton
- Cazenovia
- Camden
- Chittenango
- Cicero
- Clockville
- Dewitt
- Fayetteville
- Homer
- Lenox
- Manlius
- Minoa
- Old Forge

- Rome
- Sherill
- Skaneateles
- Sylvan Beach
- Sullivan
- Tully
- Utica
- Van Buren
- Vernon
- Verona
- Wampsville
- Watertown
- Weedsport

### Special Cases

These codenames are reserved for special cases due to personal importance.

#### Fort Myers Beach, Florida, US
Any device, regardless to whatever series it belongs to, that is the first project that require designing with DDR2 or later memory generations receives the codename "Fort Myers Beach". This is due to how such project would be seen as a significant turning point like the 2022 business trip to Fort Myers Beach, Florida.

#### Fort Myers, Florida, US
The codename "Fort Myers" was used for the [MathPad](../mathpad/) project in 2022 as it was designed there. It was my first circuit design project with a processor, specifically a microcontroller part of the STM32 series.

#### Generally Reserved Codenames

These codenames are reserved for general purpose

- Canastota, New York, US
- Clay, New York, US
  - Likely would be used with something DRAM related
- Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil
  - Planned to be used with a MediaCow Touch Mini device using the SP7021
- Dresden, Saxony, Germany
  - Likely would be used with something DRAM related

- Sandston, Virginia, US
  - Likely would be used with something DRAM related
- Virginia Beach, Virginia, US
- Whitelaw, New York, US

## Software

Standalone software projects use the names of animals. Embedded software written for hardware projects do not receive their own codename. Software written for specific hardware not developed by CTCL may receive their own codename.

### Rust
Rust projects use the names of various types of species

#### Web Software

Codenames using the names of crustaceans under the infraorder **Brachyura**, commonly known as **crabs**, are used for web software projects that utilize the Rust programming language. The inspiration of using crustaceans for Rust-based projects is from the term "Rustacean" and the unofficial mascot of Rust named Ferris.

- [Atlantic Blue Crab - CTCL Website (ctclsite-rust)](../ctclsite/)
- Atlantic Red Crab
- Atlantic Rock Crab
- [Blue Crab - ContactList (contactlist-rust)](../contactlist/)
- Dungeness Crab
- Asian Blue Crab
- [Red Rock Crab - CAMS (cams-rust)](../cams/)
- Golden Crab
- Gulf Stone Crab
- Jonah Crab
- Horsehair Crab
- Pie Crust Crab
- [Brown Crab - ToDoKiosk (todokiosk-rust)](../todokiosk/)
- Florida Stone Crab
- Dwarf Crab
- Tiger Crab

#### Chat Bots
On February 23, 2024, I have decided to have software projects of chat bots, currently for Discord, be codenamed after the common names of animals under the **Mustela** genus, also known as weasels, polecats, ferrets and stoats. Specifically, the names of **ferrets** are used. This was inspired by [Aurorans Solis](https://auroranssolis.github.io/), who I met on Discord in February 2024 and was the main inspiration for me to start using Rust again during this time.

- [Black-footed Ferret - SLAG (slag-rust)](../slag/)

### Python
Starting January 30, 2024, codenames of fish would be used for any Python-based project as started with the trout theme for web applications.

#### Web Software
Projects using the codenames of **trout** are used for projects using the Django or Flask web framework and the Python programming language. The idea of using the names of trout for codenames started with CAMS in which was inspired by excursions to fish farms during summer camp in 2018 and 2019.

- Adriatic Trout
- [Apache Trout - CTCL Website (ctclsite-python)](../ctclsite/)
- Biwa Trout
- Brook Trout
- [Brown Trout - ContactList (contactlist-python)](../contactlist/)
- Bull Trout
- Cutthroat Trout
- Flathead Trout
- Gila Trout
- Golden Trout
- Lake Trout
- Marble Trout
- Ohrid Trout
- [Rainbow Trout - CAMS (cams-python)](../cams/)
- Sevan Trout
- Silver Trout
- Tiger Trout

#### Chat bots
Starting January 30, 2024, projects using the codenames of **catfish** (Siluriformes/Nematognathi) are used for Python-based projects that are chat bots. The use of catfish for such codenames is a reference to the built-in user "Rocket.Cat" from the Rocket.Chat software and is a play on the term "catfishing".

- [Channel Catfish - SLAG](../slag/) (Python version)
