Along with the ASUS Zenfone 9 described above, I use a separate Apple iPhone XR for social media and online communication. Before April 2023, this was my main (connected to cellular network) phone but I decided to switch to Android over many different concerns with Apple. 

The phone was given to me by a friend in May 2021 and took place of the iPhone 6s I was using at the time. In September 2022, I got a Samsung Galaxy S7 (WW; SM-G930F) for music and running Android apps to use alongside the XR until both devices were eventually replaced by the Zenfone 9 in April 2023. Over concerns with namely Instagram having access to my network, photos and other private data through the Zenfone 9, I decided to start using the iPhone XR again but for social media.
