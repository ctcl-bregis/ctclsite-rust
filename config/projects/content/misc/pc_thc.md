"Tetrahydrocannabinol" (shorthand "THC") is the codename given to my smartphone that I use for day-to-day tasks and communication. This page is mostly here to act as a description for what "Tetrahydrocannabinol" refers to on other pages on this website.

In April 2023, I decided to make the switch from the Apple iPhone XR that was given to me by a friend in early 2021. I did not trust Apple and iOS made customization nearly impossible. The iPhone lacked a headphone jack, requiring me to use a separate device for music. 

I chose the ASUS Zenfone 9 because of the device's inclusion of a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, small form factor, physical camera stablization, large memory (RAM) size and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. ASUS phones seem to be uncommon, even rare, in the United States. Like many modern smartphones, the device does not have the option to add a microSD card, this was a concern at first but ended up not being a problem.
