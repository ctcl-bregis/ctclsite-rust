"Dichlorodifluoromethane" (shorthand "R12") is the small Intel desktop system currently used as SIGN1 with the current main purpose of running the [ToDoKiosk software](../todokiosk/) to display tasks on a monitor on the bookshelf next to my desk.

This system was put into production on May 13, 2023 while the system was officially given a codename on January 6, 2024.

On May 14, 2024, I have started to plan to have an ARM single-board computer take place of this system for showing the to-do list.

On May 16, 2024, a Raspberry Pi 4B single board computer took place of this desktop for ToDoKiosk. The parts from this desktop are planned to be used in other systems,
