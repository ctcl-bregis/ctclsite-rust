SVCS2 uses the hardware platform "Lisdexamfetamine" (shorthand "LDX"). This is the oldest BL460c G8 in use, with components dating to mid-2012. From June 8, 2023 to October 9, 2023, the system reported a motherboard error that was later discovered to just be the BIOS version not supporting the Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge CPUs that I attempted to install on June 8, 2023. After the original E5-2650 Sandy Bridge CPUs were installed, the system operated as normal. This configuration may be used indefinitely due to the difficulty of updating the firmware of these systems.

Currently, as of March 20, 2024, the system is used for ancillary virtualization services including [SLAG](../slag/) and other CTCL-developed services.
