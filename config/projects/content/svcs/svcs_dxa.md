SVCS3 uses the hardware platform "Dextroamphetamine" (shorthand "DXA"). I could not actually get the system to boot from the hard drive. Since SVCS1 "Levoamphetamine" and SVCS2 "Lisdexamfetamine" are more than enough for my current needs, I have not put this system in production yet.

On February 11, 2024, the E5-2643 v2 CPUs where switched for E5-2667 v2 CPUs due to the higher core count and slight increase in single-threaded performance. 

On April 5, 2024, a Minecraft server was set up bare metal on this system for use by a college club. 16GB of memory is allocated and the server has access to the 16 cores/32 threads of the two E5-2667 v2.

As covered in the [blog post for Week 12 of 2024](../../blog/15/), there has been attempts to run LLMs on this system.
