SVCS are servers that I use for hosting various network services.

The name "SVCS" is the hostname prefix for presence on the local network. For example, a hostname would be "CTCL-SVCS1". Unrelated to hostnames, like most CTCL systems, the hardware has codenames that follow the [codename guide](../codenames/). The SVCS name was used since late 2020 from when I first started to use rack mountable servers in a home environment.

Currently, the three systems listed here are part of the HP BladeSystem setup given to me in April 2023. 

From February 2023 to the introduction of the HP BladeSystem, the motherboard ["Polyethylene"](../pc_pe/) in a Supermicro chassis was used as a temporary solution to be able to sell off the HP ProLiant and Dell PowerEdge systems.

Before "Polyethylene", since late 2020 to early 2023, various 1U/2U Dell PowerEdge and HP ProLiant servers with Intel Xeon Westmere and Nehalem CPUs were used.
