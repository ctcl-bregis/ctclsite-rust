These are dedicated computer servers used for the hosting of various network services. 

The name "SVCS" is the hostname prefix for presence on the local network. For example, a hostname would be "CTCL-SVCS1". Unrelated to hostnames, like most CTCL systems, the hardware has codenames that follow the [codename guide](../codenames/). The SVCS name was used since late 2020 from when I first started to use rack mountable servers in a home environment.
