From February 2023 to the introduction of the systems above, the motherboard ["Polyethylene"](../pc_pe/) in a Supermicro chassis was used as a temporary solution to be able to sell off the HP ProLiant and Dell PowerEdge systems.

Before "Polyethylene", since late 2020 to early 2023, various 1U/2U Dell PowerEdge and HP ProLiant servers with Intel Xeon Westmere and Nehalem CPUs were used.
