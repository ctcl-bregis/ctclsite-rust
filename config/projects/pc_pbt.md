"Polybutylene Terephthalate" (shorthand "PBT) is the codename given to the hardware platform that currently serves as WBPC1 for general purpose workloads. It makes use of the ECC memory support of certain AMD Ryzen desktop CPUs and motherboards that support it. This system is able to handle workloads such as EDA, CAD and software compilation while performing well in computer gaming.

The only changes to the system were:

- From January 24, 2023 to January 27, 2023, the system used two 8GB Corsair Vengeance LPX ver8.31 (Nanya Technology NT5AD1024M8B3) in order to test the system as I did not have any Unbuffered ECC DDR4 modules yet.
- On January 27, 2023, two 8GB Samsung M391A1K43BB1-CRC 1Rx8 DDR4-2400 Unbuffered ECC modules were installed.
- On February 21, 2023, the system was rebuilt into a mini tower case, the Cooler Master N200.
- On February 23, 2023, four 8GB SK hynix HMA81GU7CJR8N-VK 1Rx8 DDR4-2666 Unbuffered ECC modules replaced the current configuration, bringing RAM capacity to 32GB. The M391A1K43BB1-CRC were later used to build ["Polycarbonate"](../pc_pc).
- On August 30, 2023, the memory configuration was replaced with two 16GB Micron Technology MTA9ASF2G72AZ-3G2B1 1Rx8 DDR4-3200 Unbuffered ECC because of performance concerns with the previous memory configuration. This memory upgrade brought significant and noticable performance improvements, especially with gaming.
- On January 13, 2024, a SK hynix Platinum P41 was added alongside the Samsung PM9A1 while the 1TB WD Black HDD was removed. This switched the system over to a "all-flash" storage configuration, bringing a significant improvement in performance for most tasks.
