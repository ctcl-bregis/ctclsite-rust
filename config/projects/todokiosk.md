ToDoKiosk was a quick project that was started and released within three hours on October 31, 2023.

This project was started in the need for a web interface that just displays tasks on a monitor that I have mounted on the side of a bookcase near my desk.

Like all of my other software projects, the project is open source and the source code can be found at GitHub. The Python version is called [todokiosk-python](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/todokiosk-python) and the Rust version is called [todokiosk-rust](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/todokiosk-rust)

## Python Version
On October 31, 2023, within a few hours, the initial version of ToDoKiosk was developed and released. 

## Rust Version
On December 23, 2023, I had the idea of recreating ToDoKiosk in Rust to reintroduce myself to the Rust programming language. The source code is also on GitHub at [this repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/todokiosk-rust).

On January 2, 2024, this rewrite was officially put on hold indefinitely as I decided there is no apparent need for me to switch the project over to Rust, a much more unfamiliar environment. On March 10, plans to attempt to rewrite ToDoKiosk in Rust appeared.

On March 10 to March 11, 2024, the Rust rewrite was done using the Actix web framework and the Python version is no longer used.
