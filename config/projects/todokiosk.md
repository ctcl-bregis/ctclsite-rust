ToDoKiosk was a quick project that was started and released within three hours on October 31, 2023.

This project was started in the need for a web interface that just displays tasks on a monitor that I have mounted on the side of a bookcase near my desk.

The project is open source and the source code is hosted on GitHub at [this repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/ToDoKiosk).

### Rust Version

On December 23, 2023, I had the idea of recreating ToDoKiosk in Rust to reintroduce myself to the Rust programming language. The source code is also on GitHub at [this repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/todokiosk-rust).

On January 2, 2024, this rewrite was officially put on hold indefinitely as I decided there is no apparent need for me to switch the project over to Rust, a much more unfamiliar environment.
