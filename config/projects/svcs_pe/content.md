"Polyethylene" is the hardware codename to the X8DAi that formerly made up a dual Intel Xeon X5670 workstation desktop I used for the majority of 2021. 

In February 2023, I repurposed the motherboard to be used as my main server to be able to sell off the Dell and HP rack servers that I used prior. This setup is planned to be used until I can afford to upgrade to modern AMD EPYC hardware.
