# Introduction
SLAG is a bot for the management of Discord guilds. SLAG is an initialism of "Security, Logging, Analytics and General Purpose". The logo is based off from this, with the goal of the bot to be "solid as steel". The project was started on January 24, 2024 in response to myself becoming president of a school club.

SLAG is the first project where I have written SQL statements for setting up databases. Its development has been a great learning experience.

# Python version
The Python version came first, with its development starting on January 24, 2024. The codename for the Python version is "Channel Catfish".

Details of the bot including its features and code can be found at the repostitory [here](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/slag).

# Rust version
I started the Rust version of the software on February 21, 2024 due to general discontent with Python including performance and runtime errors (that would be otherwise caught during compile time).

The codename of the Rust version of SLAG is currently undecided as of February 21, 2024.
