"Polyethylene" is the codename given to the Supermicro X8DAi desktop platform that I built in 2021.

Planning started in December 2020 and assembly started in January 2021. The system was used throughout 2021 up to the building of ["Polyethylene Terephthalate"](../pc_pet/) in December 2021. Throughout 2022, it was used as a lab workbench system for workflows such as virtualisation, emulation, CAD and EDA.

In February 2023, the motherboard was installed in a Supermicro CSE-825 2U chassis to use as my main server as I planned to sell off the Dell PowerEdge R710, R610 and HP ProLiant DL380 G7 that I was using at the time. Codenames that I choose for devices are linked to the motherboard and are not changed when the purpose or other parts such as the case or CPU are changed.

In August 2023, the motherboard was installed back in its original case, with the same RAM kit and the same graphics card in order to bring the system back to its original configuration after ["Polycarbonate"](../pc_pc/) and ["the HP BladeSystem"](../srv_amp/) took over the duties of the desktop and servers.

The color theme for the PC build was green/lime, teal and black. The green/lime was from the characteristic green PCB of Supermicro motherboards and the distinct green of the heatsinks of the Nanya memory modules.
