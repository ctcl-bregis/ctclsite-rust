# Introduction 
Codenames are used to differentiate between projects and computer hardware. 

The current codename system is used more or less as an inventory system until proper inventory management is set up with either [CAMS](../cams/) or something else. 

Throughout lists below, any codename that has a link and/or is in **bold** is currently in use.

# Rules for codenames 

- As of February 22, 2022, codenames shall no longer be *directly* related to real persons. Though the codename "Paris" will continue to be used by MediaCow Touch 2.
- Codenames should not be longer than 30 characters but with some exceptions when seen fit such as "polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride"

## Specific to embedded device project codenames
- Codenames for embedded device projects must have codenames of real places and not fictional ones. (e.g. Lakewood Plaza Turbo)

## Specific to workstation device codenames
- Codenames must not have symbols and numbers except for commas, dashes and numbers when they are needed to differeniate between codenames. An example of such exception is 3,7-Dimethylxanthine.
- Codenames are unique and are not reused, they are bound to the PCB (circuit board) that contains the main processor(s), such as a motherboard.
- Codenames stay linked to the motherboard even if the device's application changes such as the reuse of parts from a workstation in a server. An example of this is [Polyethylene](../pc_pe/).

# Workstation Codenames 
Chemical compounds are used for any device codename. This is different from hardware project codenames as codenames for such projects are linked to the project idea itself and not a specific device/prototype. Due to the length of many of the codenames, a shorthand version is given in this format: `<codename> - <shorthand codename>`

- The existence of a chemical compound must be verified to exist
- Starting February 6, 2024, codenames relating to chiral chemical compounds must use the names of its optical rotations

Codenames do not differeniate devices on a network; they are not hostnames or part of hostnames. Hostnames are short descriptions of what purpose the device currently serves and are seen on the network by that name, such as "SVCS" for virtualization systems.

## Names to Use 
Chemical compounds may have multiple ways to name their chemical structures. Generally, the most common chemical name for a substance is used.

For example, with Serdexmethylphenidate, the IUPAC name `(2S)-3-hydroxy-2-[[1-[[(2R)-2-[(1R)-2-methoxy-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl]piperidine-1-carbonyl]oxymethyl]pyridin-1-ium-3-carbonyl]amino]propanoate` could not be used for a device codename for multiple reasons. 

Another example, with lisdexamfetamine, the INN name is used over L-lysine-dextroamphetamine or lisdexamphetamine because the lisdexamfetamine name is more common. 

## Chlorofluorocarbons and Hydrochlorofluorocarbon 
Starting June 2, 2023, Chlorofluorocarbon and Hydrochlorofluorocarbon codenames are reserved for Intel systems without ECC memory support. This excludes devices originally classified as a Chromebook or Chromebox, as they may get a chromium compound codename. Intel systems with ECC memory support may get a plastics-related codename instead. 

On January 19, 2024, the categories for Chlorofluorocarbons and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons were extended to include Chlorofluoroolefins and Hydrochlorofluoroolefins respectively.

### Polyolefins and Polystyrene
Polyolefin codenames historically have been used with dual-socket systems and systems with high core count CPUs.

Currently, this includes any dual-socket AMD Opteron, dual-socket Intel Xeon and single-socket AMD EPYC systems. Dual-socket AMD EPYC systems may be assigned a polyvinyl codename instead.

- [Polyethylene - PE](../pc_pe/)
- Polyisobutylene - PIB
- Polymethylpentene - PMP

## Psychoactives 
Codenames of psychoactive substances are used for server hardware.

### Stimulants 
Stimulant drug-related codenames are generally for use with virtualization and compute servers.

#### Amphetamines 
HP ProLiant blade servers that were given to me on May 5, 2023 use the names of amphetamine-based stimulant chemical compounds.

Starting September 5, 2023, amphetamine-based stimulant and related prodrug chemical compound codenames are now to be used with any HP BladeSystem-compatible device. 

- **Dextroamphetamine** - "DXA"

- Dexmethylphenidate - DMP
- Levomethylphenidate - LMP
- **Serdexmethylphenidate** - SDX

#### Xanthine exception
 Codenames that are of stimulants under the xanthine/methylxanthine family are not used for servers and are instead used with certain mobile devices. This is inconsistent as stimulant names are used for servers but the use of xanthine names started with a former Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F) that I used from September 2022 to April 2023 codenamed "Trimethylxanthine". 

- Tetramethylxanthine - QMX, Methylcaffeine

- Alprazolam - AZM
- [Promethazine](../srv_pm/) - PM or PRM
- Diphenhydramine - DPH

## Thiols 
Thiol-related codenames are reserved for AMD Ryzen systems without motherboard ECC memory support. AMD Ryzen systems with ECC memory support may get a plastics-related codename instead. This includes devices with customized AMD processors using the Zen series CPU architecture such as the Valve Steam Deck's APU. Unlike the HCFC/CFC theme for Intel-based devices, codenames for these devices are chosen regardless to their form factor.

- **Butanethiol** - BTH

ARM-based Chromebook and Chromebox systems are excluded from codenaming as there is currently no known way to replace their Google-developed firmware.

## Special 
Special chemical compound names are reserved for rare hardware platforms.

Devices that would have a "special" codename include but is obviously not limited to:

- Contains an SoC part of the MagicEyes MMSP series
- Contains an SoC part of the Ingenic Jz47xx series outside of development kits
- Contains a Chips&Technologies GPU, video controller or CPU
- Sold under the brand "Positivo" or "Positivo BGH" (common in Latin America, especially Brazil, but rare in the US)

### Antimatter 
- **Positronium Hydride**

### Ions 
- Helium Hydride

# Embedded Project Codenames 
Embedded circuit design projects are codenamed after specific locations such as cities, towns and villages.

The design idea is what receives the codename, unlike the workstation codenames that are linked to a single unique motherboard.

## DRAM Plant Locations 
Projects that surround the testing or demonstration of computer DRAM are named after locations are or were locations of significant DRAM plants.

- Boise, Idaho
- Clay, New York
- Sandston, Virginia
- Seoul, South Korea
- Dresden, Germany

# Software 
Standalone software projects use the names of animals. Embedded software written for hardware projects do not receive their own codename. Software written for specific hardware not developed by CTCL may receive their own codename.

## Rust

### Web Software
Codenames using the names of **crabs** are used for web software projects that utilize the Rust programming language. The inspiration of using crustaceans for Rust-based projects is from the term "Rustacean" and the unofficial mascot of Rust named Ferris.

- [Atlantic Blue Crab - ctclsite-rust](../ctclsite/)

## Python
Starting January 30, 2024, codenames of fish would be used for any Python-based project as started with the trout theme for web applications.

### Web Software
Projects using the codenames of **trout** are used for projects using the Django or Flask web framework and the Python programming language. The idea of using the names of trout for codenames started with CAMS in which was inspired by excursions to fish farms during summer camp in 2018 and 2019.

- Adriatic Trout
- [Apache Trout - ctclsite-python](../ctclsite/)
- Biwa Trout
- Brook Trout
- [Brown Trout - ContactList](../contactlist/)
- Bull Trout
- Cutthroat Trout 
- Flathead Trout
- Gila Trout
- Golden Trout
- Lake Trout
- Marble Trout
- Ohrid Trout
- [Rainbow Trout - CAMS](../cams/)
- Sevan Trout
- Silver Trout
- Tiger Trout

### Chat bots
Starting January 30, 2024, projects using the codenames of **catfish** (Siluriformes/Nematognathi) are used for Python-based projects that are chat bots. The use of catfish for such codenames is a reference to the built-in user "Rocket.Cat" from the Rocket.Chat software and is a play on the term "catfishing".

- [Channel Catfish - SLAG](../slag/) (Python version)
