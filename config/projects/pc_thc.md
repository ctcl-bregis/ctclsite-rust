"Tetrahydrocannabinol" (shorthand "THC") is the codename given to my smartphone that I use for day-to-day tasks and communication. 

In April 2023, I decided to make the switch from the Apple iPhone XR that was given to me by a friend in early 2021. I did not trust Apple and the device lacked a headphone jack, requiring me to use a separate device for music. 

I chose the ASUS Zenfone 9 because of the device's inclusion of a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, small form factor, camera stablization and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1.
