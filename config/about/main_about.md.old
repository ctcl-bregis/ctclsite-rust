## Where am I?
Currently, I am within the Richmond area in Virginia, United States. 

I was born within Syracuse, New York then lived in Oneida, New York for a major part of my life. 

## Who am I?
My real name is Brayden Regis.

### Education 
On May 23, 2022, I have officially graduated from Clover Hill High School in Midlothian, Virginia, United States with a standard diploma.

During the 2021-2022 Senior school year, I have attended the Chesterfield Tech Center. I have assisted in the development of the [7429 Convergence robot during the 2022 Rapid React FIRST Robotics Competition](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2022/team/7429).

### Employment
For the summer and winter breaks of 2020 and 2021, I have been employed at [2nd Life Inc.](https://2ndlifeinc.com/)


### Why "Crazyblocks"?
I have used the name "Crazyblocks" since 2011. It was chosen after a quick decision for an username to use on a now popular multiplayer computer game. When I started using the name for other computer games, the name stuck.

Now the name is used mainly for my open source projects and personal work.

## The Website

### Technical Details
The website uses Python, HTML and CSS. I wrote the Python, HTML and CSS myself, with the exception of some Python libraries that are featured, such as [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) (included in Flask), [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) and [markdown2](https://pypi.org/project/markdown2/). No website builders or other similar tools were used.

The website is hosted in New York City, United States by DigitalOcean on one AMD EPYC Rome core as part of the ["Premium AMD Droplet" plan](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/premium-droplets-intel-cascade-lake-amd-epyc-rome).
