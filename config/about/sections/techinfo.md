This website is one of my ongoing software projects. 

Currently, the website backend is written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Actix Web framework](https://actix.rs/). For the frontend, the website does not make use of any frontend web framework and instead HTML and CSS is generated by the backend using [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) templates. More about the website and its source code is at [the project page for this website](./projects/ctclsite/).
