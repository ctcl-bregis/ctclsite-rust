Since June 30, 2022 until now, I have been working on a rewrite of the website.

Improvements:

- Easier for me to maintain
- General performance improvements
- Better organization of code
- Addition of the feature to define content with Markdown (.md) files
- Better portability 
- Improvements to logging
- Major improvements to RAMList
