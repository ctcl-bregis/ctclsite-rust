I made a blog for the website. Here I can show what I am working on, post guides and more.
Like the rest of the website, parts of this blog is automated with the help with Python Flask on the backend.
Posts have a topic, for example this post is under "Meta"

- Guide - General guide
- Personal - Relating to me
- Meta - Relating to the website/blog
- Teardown - Device teardown and hardware overview
