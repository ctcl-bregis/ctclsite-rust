# Background
RAMList was a section of my website that had lists of computer memory modules describing the DRAM parts they used.

In August 2023, it has been made aware to me that the lists were often misleading due to how device vendors switch components being used in their products. I was somewhat aware about this before and I had a warning about it on each page. I had no idea that module vendors changed components that often and how this could render a lot of the content on RAMList worthless.

# Future
With recent updates with my website, I have generally removed code related to RAMList and any mentions of it. 

If there is any interest in bringing back RAMList in a guide-like format, I may start working on it again.
