For me, personally, 2023 was quite a challenging period of time. Some of these challenges faced were related to relationships, computers and finance.

I plan to significantly improve my life throughout 2024 from learning from the events in my life during 2023.

# Projects
In 2023, I released a less than anticipated amount of projects.

During 2023, I released just software projects due to the challenges faced with the assembly of hardware projects. Most of these were just revisions of [the website](../../projects/ctclsite/).

In 2023, these projects were released:

- [ContactList](../../projects/contactlist/)
- ctclsite-python v3
- ctclsite-python v4
- ctclsite-python v5
- ctclsite-rust v1
- [ToDoKiosk](../../projects/todokiosk/)

## Game Design
In 2023, I made many online friends after gaining more interest in the development of maps for the 2011 puzzle game, Portal 2. I added a page to Projects relating to this [here](../../projects/p2maps/).

## ctclsite-python v5
Before the end of the year, I have released the fifth rewrite of the Python version of the website.

During my short session at Brightpoint Community College from September to December, I learned quite a few things about web development that I applied during the development of this release.

Not much of the "backend" code was changed and instead this update had its focus on the "frontend" with major changes to the overall look of the website.

RAMList is no longer part of the website. Originally with the v4 update, I planned to have RAMList a written guide instead of a list of memory modules due to the misleading nature of the lists. For the time being, RAMList will not be added back to the website unless there is some interest for it.

# Employment
For the most of 2023, I was unemployed and instead turned to personal projects.

I decided to cease employment at 2nd Life Inc. due to multiple factors on April 7, 2023. However, there may be a chance I might consider coming back.

With a decrease of activity at Atlantic Estimating, I was not needed for most of 2023.

## Florida

In June and September 2023, I revisited the Fort Myers Beach, Florida area after my long business trip in the beginning of November 2022 relating to the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. These subsequent visits to the area were important to me as the original November 2022 business trip was a major turning point in my life.
