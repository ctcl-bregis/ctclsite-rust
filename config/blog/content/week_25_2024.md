# Projects

## Software
With software, I have been looking into UI design aspects more this week.

### Pixel Fonts
Once again, the Pixel font series took up much more time than I wanted it to.

On June 23, 2024, I finally came up with an alternate font that would look good on my website when used with *'Pixel-12x12 Condensed'*, which is *'Pixel-16x16 Condensed'*. This font was implemented on the website and now is used for some header text and buttons on the website. Unlike most websites, a different but similar font is used for different size text. 

### Website
I made some updates to the website during this week, mostly for implementing the Pixel fonts described in the section above.

## Hardware
Starting Week 26, I will go into hardware development again.

### MediaCow Touch 2
I have some great news: LattePanda/DFRobot would be providing development hardware for MediaCow Touch 2 "Paris". This officially switches the plan of MediaCow Touch 2 using a Rockchip ARM-based System on Module to the LattePanda Mu using an x86-64 processor.

I entered the LattePanda Mu Free Trial Event in late-May, 2024. 

At around 3 AM at June 20, 2024, at the end of the application stage of the project, I received an email asking for more information on how the system on module is utilized in my idea. I have already forgotten about the Free Trial Event because I did not expect the idea to be of interest since many handheld tablets using x86 processors have existed in the past. However, MediaCow Touch 2 would be unique in many ways. 

I stayed up until 4 AM on June 24, 2024 to design a quite primitive block diagram on how I imagined LattePanda Mu is used in the project. The diagram has some errors as it was rushed but it does describe what I had in mind with the idea.

On June 23, 2024, I have received an email about the idea being approved and to provide information on having development hardware being shipped to me. Some valuable ideas were given for improving the design. I am deeply grateful for this opportunity and having such development hardware would make this project possible. 

The ideas that were provided were: 
- Using an embedded controller MCU for battery management instead of connecting the fuel gauge and charge controller directly to the LattePanda Mu
- Using another MCU for volume controls, this could also allow for customizability 
- Use of a USB audio CODEC instead of using the HD Audio interface

MediaCow Touch 2 may now take up most of my time due to my limited skillset and the complexity of the project. In 2020, I did not expect to build the first MediaCow Touch, codenamed "Nashville", within the time period that I had but I made it happen anyway. 

Since 2021, I have been coming up with ideas for MediaCow Touch 2 but none of them were feasible given my limited knowledge at the time.  

## PC Hardware
Since Week 23 and as mentioned in the last weekly update, I have been considering a display upgrade for a ThinkPad T430s. 

The reason why I use a ThinkPad T430s from mid-2012 over the newer [HP ZBook G3 Studio](../../projects/pc_pmma/) for most workloads on the go is that it manages to stay cool. The HP ZBook, however, does not, the CPU reaches 50-80C temperatures on basic tasks such as running a browser (Firefox, Ungoogled Chromium, etc.), updating packages with apt or running VSCodium (especially when using Rust). The ZBook overheating is likely result of putting a realitively high-power Workstation/Server-grade CPU (45W TDP Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5) along with a 40W TDP GPU ([Nvidia Quadro M1000M](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/quadro-m1000m.c2739)) in a laptop while making such laptop as thin as possible. 

Even now, in 2024, the T430s handles everday workloads with the cooling fan barely being heard. A noticable improvement is seen when Spectre and Meltdown mitigations are disabled with the `mitigations=off` option in `/etc/default/grub`. During this week, I have done one upgrade so far which is switching out the 2011-era OCZ 120GB SSD (Sandforce controller, Micron/Intel SLC flash and no DRAM) for a 250GB Micron Crucial MX500 SSD which has shown a vast improvement in performance and even power usage. 

I have yet to start gathering parts for upgrading the display in the T430s as I am still unsure where to source the LVDS-eDP board. 

# Personal
This week I have started to put in some effort into improving my lifestyle.
