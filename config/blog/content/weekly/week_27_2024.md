Due to other things that have been going on, I have not written much for this week.

## Software

### The Website
Starting July 5, 2024, all fonts displayed on the website are part of the Pixel series. 

## Hardware

### MediaCow Touch 2
On July 1, 2024, I received the LattePanda Mu development kit. I was initially surprised at how small the module was with it being smaller than Raspberry Pi-format single-board computers.

On July 5, 2024, I have received the 1920x1080 11.6" eDP touchscreen display from DFRobot. This would allow me to measure the display myself to get all of the required dimensions.

I found out that the cable that I received with the display is not flat cable (FPC) which has the measurement of the position of the connector not critical for circuit design. Though this measurement is still required for the placement of the connector cutout in the screen mount part.

I have finished the first version of the case design this week. The case has been the easiest part of the project other than branding.

More information about the progress of the device during this time period will be covered in another blog post specific to it.
