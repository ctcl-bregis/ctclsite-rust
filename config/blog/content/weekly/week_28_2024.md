## Projects
Other projects have been overshadowed by MediaCow Touch 2.

### Software
Starting July 9, 2024, Sass/SCSS is no longer allowed to be used in CTCL software projects.

#### The Website
I have been improving on the fonts used on the website and adding more aesthetic features. Though these features are small and barely noticeable.

On July 10, 2024, I came up with the idea to use Tera to also generate CSS styling used on the website. It is more convenient as I can just use Tera to produce both HTML and CSS for the website, removing a dependency. If successful, this would be applied to my other projects such as ContactList and CAMS.

On July 14, 2024, I finally added a "3D" button effect to blog and project page links. 

### Hardware

#### MediaCow Touch 2
I have continued to work on MediaCow Touch 2 as much as possible. I have covered my progress so far in [this blog post](../mct2_p1/).

## Personal
This was yet another difficult week for myself personally. Within the last few months, it has been difficult to go outside due to the immense heat and humidity now faced in Central Virginia with humidity up to 80% and temperatures up to 99F/37C. I have considered going out past sundown but temperature and humidity still persists then.

For the United States, this week was quite eventful but not in a good way.

I may start another break from Instagram but checking it for important messages only.
