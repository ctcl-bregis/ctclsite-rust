## Software
Starting July 9, 2024, Sass/SCSS is no longer allowed to be used in any of my projects. 

On July 10, 2024, I came up with the idea to use Tera to also generate CSS styling used on the website. It is more convenient as I can just use Tera to produce both HTML and CSS for the website, removing a dependency. If successful, this would be applied to my other projects such as ContactList and CAMS.

### The Website
I have been improving on the fonts used on the website and adding more aesthetic features.
