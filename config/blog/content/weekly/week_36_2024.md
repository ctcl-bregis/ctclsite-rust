### MediaCow Touch 2

### SLAG and ContactList
Recently, I have been learning more about databases and how they are used. 

I discovered that CouchDB would not be an effective solution for SLAG though it may be useful for ContactList. I may go back to using a relational database for SLAG. 

### Sunplus Plus1
Due to MediaCow Touch 2, I have been avoiding other hardware projects. Recently I have gained interest in the Sunplus Plus1 series including the SP7021 and the newly released SP7350.

I had the joke idea to use the SP7021 in MediaCow Touch 2 as the embedded controller instead of the STM32L496 but this would not happen for multiple reasons, notably that the SP7021 uses quite a bit of power as it would get too hot to touch from my testing, even at the bootloader stage. Even with tons of optimization to lower power usage, it still would not make sense to use a Quad Cortex-A7 + ARM926 + 512MB RAM SiP for something that a 48MHz Cortex-M4 microcontroller can do.

On September 1, 2024, I dug out the Banana Pi BPI-F2P to photograph an example of the Flipper Zero USB-UART app in action. The photo was intended for use in a flyer for a college club as it demonstrates embedded hardware.
