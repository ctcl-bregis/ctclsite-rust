## Projects
Starting this week, I would no longer split this section into categories like "Hardware", "Software" and "PC Hardware" and instead I would just list the projects.

### The Website
I have been making gradual changes to the look of the website as I add documentation about MediaCow Touch 2.

### Leinfors
On July 18, 2024, I first heard of the [passing of Leinfors](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/the-passing-of-an-icon-leinfors.117840), an icon of the Terraria community, in February 2023.

In April 2023, he was the main basis for myself to move on from the "elf" theming using a <span style="color: #009900">green color scheme (#009900)</span> to theming based off Alucard from Castlevania. Part of it is my extensive use of the color <span style="color: #f0d000">gold (#F0D000)</span>, which is also seen on this webpage.

It is deeply saddening that this has happened to someone so kind and intelligent. Jason was of great importance to myself though my interactions with him were very minimal; I only ever had one interaction with him which was on the Terraria Forums in August 2022 for his birthday. In presumably April 2023, unaware of the situation, I sent a friend request on Discord since I wanted to meet him online but I have not seen him on Discord since 2022. 

This brings emotions that were previously unknown to me. Most of July 18 to July 20, 2024 were spent with tears in my eyes.

How I could have not found out about this is likely due to multiple reasons. For one, I have not been playing Terraria that much within the last year and a half. My activity with the game peaked in November 2022 to January 2023 but I have started to play it less since then. On the wiki, the Terraria News section is usually covered up with the "Terraria Wiki" pop-up when I view the the wiki on my third monitor, a 17" Dell 1704FPV. Though, on Vivalidi, which I have started to use in place of Ungoogled Chromium starting in late-May, early-June 2024, the Terraria News section is partially visible. In most cases I go immediately for the search button to search for whatever I am trying to figure out in-game without paying attention to anything else on screen.

On July 19, 2024, the codename for the MediaCow Touch Mini SP7021, the first project in its series, was switched from "Curitibia" to "Floyds Knobs" which is the location of Re-Logic. (I would finish MediaCow Touch 2 first, of course)
