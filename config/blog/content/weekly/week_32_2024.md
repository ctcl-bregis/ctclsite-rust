## Projects
As usual, I have been limiting myself to just one project.

### MediaCow Touch 2
Progress is covered in the blog post: [MediaCow Touch 2 - Part 6](/blog/mct2_p6/)

## Personal
On August 8, 2024, I begun a return trip to Fort Myers Beach, Florida. I returned to Virginia on August 11, 2024. This is the fourth time I have traveled there. This was to look at a property again that just receieved flood damage again from the recent tropical storm.

Progress with MediaCow Touch 2 seemed to struggle a lot due to emotional health; mostly social isolation. This trip seemed to help with it as it had me be in public places and see other people. 

Since my initial introduction to the Fort Myers Beach area in November 2022, I have seen the place as a symbol of the effects of climate change. When I am there, I seem to have a slight feeling of uncertainity for the future.

When I go back to the places I have done inspection work, I see myself drawing out each part of the building in Xactimate, especially with a restaurant that has a quite complex roof layout. 

On the trip, I rode in and drove a Volvo for the first time; a 2024 XC40 Hybrid. Though electric assist is present, it had quite a bit of power for an inline 3 engine.
