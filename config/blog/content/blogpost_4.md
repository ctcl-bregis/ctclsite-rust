# Projects

## CAMS
For CAMS, I started to come up with a better plan for how I am going to write the software. The project has suffered in the past from the lack of planning with the immense perceived size of the project.

## ContactList
I started working on ContactList again for version 0.6.0. This update adds Bootstrap which required me to rewrite all of the HTML and styling.

## WBPC
On January 13, 2024, I finally installed another SSD into ["Polybutylene Terephthalate"](../../projects/pc_pbt/). The system now has one SK hynix P41 1TB NVMe SSD and one Samsung PM9A1 512GB SSD. I ended up having to back up and reinstall both Windows 10 and Linux Mint. This event, however, let me update to the new Linux Mint 21.3 "Virginia" release. 

## Website
I have been gradually adding more features and content to this website within the last couple weeks.

## Other
I finally made a repository for a People Playground mod that I had been adding to since February 2023. The mod mostly consists of objects for exploring the possibilities of the game's (Unity's) physics.

# Personal

## North Carolina
I had an interesting business trip this week to the Outer Banks area of North Carolina. I did not have to do any work related to it but it gave me time for working on personal projects in a different environment.
