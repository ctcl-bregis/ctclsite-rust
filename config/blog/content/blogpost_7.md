The fifth week of this year has been interesting.

# Projects
As always, I have been working on some projects of some sort.

## Software
Software development remains to have a higher priority over hardware developement because of ease and necessity.

### SLAG
I have been steadily writing SLAG. This week, I have started to implement an SQLite3 database for logging and user profiling for the bot. Since this is the first time I have written a chat bot for any platform, I am learning as I develop.

### Website
I have been adding more content to this website. This week, I have started to make a section of the website relating to a school club that I just recently have been put in charge of.

## Hardware Design
In the blog post about [Week 4](../6/), I mentioned a project that I was working on. The project was recently put on hold indefinitely because of difficulties with the Allwinner F1C200s SoC. It is likely that I would not continue working on the project.

### MediaCow 
This week, I have been brainstorming and recording ideas about potential MediaCow devices. As hardware development is expensive, complex and difficult, it is likely that I would not start or continue any projects in the MediaCow mobile device series any time soon.

On February 3, 2024, I have plugged in and booted the [MediaCow Touch "Nashville" device project from 2020](../../projects/mct_1). The device is still fully functional after three years.

# Work
Like earlier weeks of this year, I have been getting some work activity.

## Atlantic Estimating
During this week, I had my most difficult Matterport and Xactimate job yet.
