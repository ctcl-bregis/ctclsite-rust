## The website
After starting to use an iPhone XR for social media purposes, I checked how my website is displayed on iOS Safari. I noticed section background videos on the "About" page would open fullscreen, not load or not play automatically. I added the "loop" and "playsinline" attributes to the video elements in order to fix this.
