# Projects
Unlike past weeks, I have done more work in circuit design than software. Like last week, this week was considerably unproductive.

## Software
Not much was done in software this week other than maintaining this website.

## Hardware
Just one hardware project has been in development this week

### Flipper Zero Audio Module
On April 16, 2024, I designed a version of the module using the Analog Devices/Maxim Integrated MAX9867.

Later, on April 19, 2024, I designed a version of the module using the Texas Instruments TLV320DAC3203 that costs less than the MAX9867 and TLV320AIC3253.

The version of the module using the TLV320DAC3203 is expected to be the one that reaches production. Due to ease of use, the IC may be also be used in MediaCow Micro device designs.

## Home Improvement
At the beginning of the week, work on the entry floor and door replacement has finished.

On April 20, 2024, the hardwood flooring that was removed was put back together sort of like a puzzle.

# Personal
Not much personally has happened this week.
