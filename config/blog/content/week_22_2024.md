Some but not a lot of progres

### The Website
This week I have begun a total rewrite of HTML templates and SCSS styling as it was needed. Minimal changes to backend code would be required. 

### Fonts
Since last week, I have been continuing to work on pixel art fonts for use on this websites, making changes and fixes. I have looked into converting some of the lower resolution fonts to bitmap formats such as BDF and U8g2, the latter for use on embedded devices such as the Flipper Zero. 

Progress can be seen at the [pixel-fonts repository at GitHub](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/pixel-fonts/).

## Personal

### College
On Tuesday, May 28, 2024, I had a successful meeting for being enrolled in a program at Brightpoint Community College. While I was on campus, I have signed up for Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 classes. 

### Driving
This was quite an eventful week. I have finally completed the long-awaited road trip with my father for when I have received my driver's license. 

On the last day of the trip, Saturday, June 1, 2024, I went to Delaware for the first time while I was driving back from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
