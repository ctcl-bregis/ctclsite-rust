On August 1, 2024, the Instagram account for LattePanda (lattepanda_cn) [posted two of my photos of test setups of the LattePanda Mu Lite Carrier Board](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ILIotJvlu/).

The first photo shows the Windows 11 setup where the Lite Carrier Board with the Mu is shown on top of the WBPC2 "Polycarbonate" desktop (HP Z240). The second photo is of me testing the eDP display connection but not the photo of the display in action that shows the Linux Mint neofetch readout.

I did not have any prior notice about the Instagram posts though these pictures are freely available. It is likely that the team did not know about my presence on Instagram so
