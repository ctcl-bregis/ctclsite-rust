# Projects

## Software
This week, I have started to get back into using the Rust programming language. Before taking on any project with Rust, I have decided to teach myself more about the programming language. 

### SLAG
On February 21, 2024, I decided to start writing a version of SLAG in Rust that would soon replace the Python version.

## Hardware
Due to the lack of financing, I do not plan to start working on any circuit design projects any time soon. I have been preparing some Lenovo ThinkPad laptops for resale in order to get some funding for these kinds of projects.

## PC Hardware
As mentioned above, I have been working on selling some Lenovo ThinkPads from 2011-2014 in order to raise funding for projects. Surprisingly, I have been short on memory modules to prepare laptops with.

# Personal
On February 24, 2024, I helped set up and move some servers at the [High Performance Computing section of VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University)](https://research.vcu.edu/cores/hprc/facilities/). Past experience with datacenter hardware with my employment at 2nd Life Inc and management of [SVCS](../../projects/srv_amp/) was greatly helpful for what I worked on.
