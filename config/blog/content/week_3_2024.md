# Projects

## Hardware Design
This week, I went through many of my circuit design projects to organize my ideas. 

### MathPad
I officially released the design for [MathPad](../../projects/mathpad/) onto a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/mathpad) on January 19, 2024. 

### MediaCow
MediaCow mobile projects were a major part of the reorganization. Since 2021, I have been working on some of these mobile device projects but I have not gotten past the circuit design phase for multiple reasons, some of them being the overestimation of my skills (see Dunning-Kruger effect), lack of planning and finance.

I may start working on a MediaCow device again, just one project at a time.

## Software
I did not do much in software development this week other than the management of this website.

## Servers
From January 17 to January 20, I have been working on adding more web services to the "main" virtualization server, ["Methamphetamine" (HP ProLiant BL460c G8)](../../projects/srv_amp).

Apart of the addition of services, other network improvements have been done.

## Creative Work

### nonmonolithic
The nonmonolithic project has been officially "linked" to CTCL (myself) following an Instagram story post on January 15, 2024 linking to this [page](../../projects/nonmono).

### Portal 2
I have been working on maps for the Portal 2 mod, Forbidden Testing Tracks with others to greatly improve the visuals, puzzles and more throughout the game.

# Work

## Atlantic Estimating
Like the first week, I have been starting to get more Xactimate-bound work with a complicated sketch that was started on January 20, 2024.

I have not gotten any Matterport-related work for a while now.
