# Projects
Project activity was lower than usual this week.

## Software
This week I have started to use the Rust programming language again. Instead of immediately starting a project, I have went ahead and completed a significant portion of [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) to better familiarize myself with Rust.

### ctclsite-rust v1
This week I have started work to work on the second Rust rewrite of the website not because it needed it but instead to reintroduce myself to the Rust programming language. Because I am able to reuse almost all of the templates and configuration files without modification, this process went much smoother than expected.

In order to get this release out by midnight March 3, 2024 some features had to be left out of the initial release, version 1.1.0.

### SLAG
The Rust version of SLAG was assigned the codename "Black-footed Ferret". 

Development of SLAG was put on hold until ctclsite-rust is released.

# Personal
This week was a bit personally challenging due to the ongoing shortage of certain medications. I have not gotten as much work done as I wanted to this week.

On March 2, 2024, I once again helped at the [High Performance Computing section of VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University)](https://research.vcu.edu/cores/hprc/facilities/). This time I mostly pulled hard drives and InfiniBand cables.
