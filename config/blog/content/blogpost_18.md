# Projects
This week was slow for project development. Not nearly as much was completed as I wanted.

## Software
Software development was slow this week.

### ContactList
Some work has been done with ContactList. I finally was able to automatically manage the database and database migrations with the Rust Diesel ORM. Nearly the same method is used with Diesel as what was done with Python Django's ORM.

### The Website
I have continued to work on version 1.6.0 of the website which I expected to have deployed by April 15, 2024 but by how it looks, that would not happen. 

I have started to consider more of a "rolling release" concept in updating the website instead of using versions. Unlike ContactList and ToDoKiosk, the source code of this website is expected to be used by just myself since it is made for this personal website. 

Another concern I have with website updating is that the source code does not always match the source code on the GitHub repository at a given moment since I compile and upload the binary directly to the web server unlike the former Python version of the website that updated directly from GitHub. A potential solution to this is to have the "mkrelease" script commit and push changes automatically.

## Hardware
One small hardware project was completed this week.

### Flipper Zero Audio Module
On April 12, 2024, I designed an audio module PCB for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) that makes use of the SAI pins that are available through the GPIO headers on the Flipper. The module is for using the Flipper Zero as a portable audio player. I do not have a Flipper Zero so the design was mostly a proof of concept to see if it was possible. Just two ICs were used: the TI [TLV320AIC3253](https://www.ti.com/product/TLV320AIC3253) and a single 1.8v LDO regulator.

I would release the design once it is finalized; reviewed by someone who knows what they are doing.

## Misc.
On Sunday, April 14, 2024, me and my father started a much-needed project on repairing a section of floor at the entrance foyer. On this day specifically, I mixed and poured concrete for the first time. 

# Personal
This was personally a difficult week.

## Work
On April 8, 2024, I looked at two buildings, one in Henrico and one in Richmond that is just down the street from 2nd Life Inc. Just after that, I saw the eclipse, which was just partial in Virginia and nothing like it was further north.
