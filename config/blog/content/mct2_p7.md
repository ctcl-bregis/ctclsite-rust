### Cost
The quest for finding components with the lowest implementation cost that would work for whatever I am trying to achieve has been more time consuming than I wanted it to. Money remains to be a finite resource.

## Software Development
I was sent an unopened LattePanda Full-Function Evaluation Carrier Board which is a crucial part for developing software for MediaCow Touch 2 and other projects using the LattePanda Mu. I am eternally grateful for receiving the board. 

### Hardware Information Dumps
Within the last couple weeks, I have planned on making a repository for hardware information of the LattePanda Mu and its two evaluation boards. This repository would include photos of the unit, dumps from I2C devices and other devices.

This information would be useful in the development of system firwmare (BIOS), embedded controller software and hardware.

## Progress
By the time of writing, August 20, 2024, I am nearing the deadline. 

What I now expect to have done by August 26 is:
- Idea
- Branding
- Documentation
- Case design
- Schematic

I would have gotten more done, such as the PCB design, if personal factors were optimal. On August 26, 2024, I finally return to college where I get to see others. In the last five days before September 1, 2024, I would have other tasks but I may be able to continue development then.
