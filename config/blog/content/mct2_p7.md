### Cost
The quest for finding components with the lowest implementation cost that would work for whatever I am trying to achieve has been more time consuming than I wanted it to. Money remains

## Software Development
CrashSys sent me an unopened LattePanda Full-Function Evaluation Carrier Board which is a crucial part for developing software for MediaCow Touch 2 and other projects using the LattePanda Mu. I am eternally grateful for receiving the board. 

### Hardware Information Dumps
Within the last couple weeks, I have planned on making a repository for hardware information of the LattePanda Mu and its two evaluation boards. This repository would include photos of the unit, dumps from I2C devices and other devices.

This information would be useful in the development of system firwmare (BIOS), embedded controller software and hardware.
