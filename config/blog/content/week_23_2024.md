I have not been updating the blog due to significant changes in the website along with the addition of new features. Current personal situations have made these updates take much longer than they should have. 

Despite being late on two blog posts, I have written them anyway and had their dates on days of when they should have been released.

## Projects
I have been slowly working on personal projects.

### Pixel Fonts
As usual, I have been coming up with new Pixel fonts for use in various projects.

### The Website
I finally have finished the rewrite of HTML and CSS for the website on Monday, June 10, 2024 (Week 24), a day late but still on time for the blog post.

Personal factors and overall complexity of the rewrite caused myself to miss two blog posts that I have ended up writing anyway. 

## Personal
I had my 20th birthday on Friday, June 7, 2024.

On Saturday, June 8, 2024, I went to a birthday party of someone who I have not met before in person but I knew them from a college club. I enjoyed the party and done many new things.
