## CTCL Website (ctclsite)
After the successful but rushed release of the second Rust backend rewrite of the website, I have been adding some general updates to the website.

### Updates
1.2.0 was mostly fixes and optimizations that were not caught during development due to the release being rushed. The "lite" version of the website was removed as it was not really needed because little features required JavaScript. 

1.3.0 added favicons which are generated when the website "package" is built. Unless overridden, these favicons are simply just a square with the color of the page's theme. 

As always, one can view the changelog at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/ctclsite-rust/blob/main/RELEASES.md).
