# Projects
Instead of just software, me and my father have been making great progress with NetKart Phase 2

## Software
With software projects, I have started to explore the use of databases with Rust-based web applications.

### [CAMS](../../projects/cams/)
I have decided to start working on CAMS once I have finished the Rust version of ContactList as they are quite similar. It is unknown when I am going to get a working version of ContactList done but an obvious timeline would be before 2025.

### [ContactList](../../projects/contactlist/)
I have been doing more research on how ContactList would be structured and how it would manage its database. I have messaged with some on the development team for the Rust Diesel ORM to get some ideas on how to efficiently generate and use database schema defined in a configuration file like how the original Python-based ContactList managed its database.

### [The Website](../../projects/ctclsite/)
This week, I have started to work on a new release adding more features to the website.

During April 3, 2024, I have went through and either fixed or completely rewritten content for pages under "Projects". This was in response to me constantly discovering bad grammar and missing content throughout these pages.

## Mechanical
As usual, the only mechanical project I have worked on is NetKart. 

### [NetKart Phase 2](../../projects/netkart/)
We decided that we would start working on welding the frame before continuing work on the mechanical parts such as engine modification and mounting.

The welder jammed once again, but this was after the set screw for the wire feed section broke off, this effectively stopped us from welding any more during that session.

My experience from this project has siginficantly improved my welding skills.

# Personal
Week 14 was somewhat personally difficult. I have continued to work towards getting my drivers license so I could be able to attend more functions.
