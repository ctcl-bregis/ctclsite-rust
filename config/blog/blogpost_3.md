I have noticed that I have not added anything to this blog except for posts relating to how it was programmed.

### State of Projects ###

MediaCow Touch 2, POW Card (from OK KO Let's Be Heroes) and other computer hardware-related projects have been put on hold for the time being. 

Mainly due to the state of the supply chain, it has been difficult to find integrated circuits and other components with a reliable stock status. I have switched form using EasyEDA to KiCAD for hardware development. KiCAD has a different learning curve so I would be learning how to use the software while developing hardware. I do not plan to have any working prototypes of such devices any time soon. 

Current projects:

- CTCL Website including RAMList, version 2.1.1 just uploaded
- Toaster oven used as a reflow oven (Adafruit "EZ Make Oven" guide) 
- CAMS inventory management software  
- Cleaning up the work area (the "Laboratory")
- Experimentation surrounding a newly-built desktop with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600

Outside of personal projects, I have been working on college, job searching and other life-related things. It is important to prioritize life.
