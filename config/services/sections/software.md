I can aid in the design and development of various types of software. 

## Language Experience
I mainly use the Python programming language for server-side and client-side software projects because of its popularity and ease of use, allowing myself to complete projects faster.

For software in applications that require performance such as embedded devices and data processing, the Rust programming language is used. Other languages are used when they are needed.

### Advanced Experience
I have the most experience with these programming languages in these applications.

- Python - Server/web applications
    - Flask and Django web frameworks
        - [This Website - ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/)
        - [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)
        - [ToDoKiosk](../projects/todokiosk) 
        - [CAMS](../projects/cams/)
    - Pycord, discord.py bot frameworks
        - [SLAG](../projects/slag/)

### Intermediate Experience
I have some experience with these programming languages in these applications.

- C# - Game development
    - So far only used in the context of making mods for games using the Unity game engine
- Python - Embedded
    - MicroPython, CircuitPython
        - Modifications to the [Adafruit "EZ Make Oven"](https://learn.adafruit.com/ez-make-oven/installing-the-code) code
        - Some experimentation with the Raspberry Pi Pico

### Beginner Experience
I do not have that much experience in these programming languages in the listed applications but I am willing to learn more about them.

- Rust - Server/web applications
    - Actix Web
        - [ctclsite-rust](../projects/ctclsite/)
- Rust - Embedded
    - So far just hardware experimentation, no use in projects yet
- JavaScript - Web applications
    - Minimal general use within web applications, sometimes with jQuery
        - [This Website - ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/)
- C - Embedded
    - [MediaCow Touch "Nashville"](../projects/mct_1/) 
    - Various school projects

## Web Design Experience

I can design and develop websites and web software of varying complexities by hand, with web frameworks or with web editors.

This entire website is designed, developed and maintained by myself. The project page related to it can be found [here](../projects/ctclsite/).

I have released a couple other web application projects so far called [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/) and [ToDoKiosk](../projects/todokiosk).
