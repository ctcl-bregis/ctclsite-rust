## Language Experience
I have started to learn about software development and programming in late 2021 in order to start working on [CAMS](../projects/cams/).

Up to February 2024, I mainly used the Python programming language for server-side and client-side software projects because of its popularity and ease of use, allowing myself to complete projects faster. I have begun to use the Rust programming language for more types of projects since then. I can learn and use other programming languages when needed.

## Web Design
I have extensive experience in developing and maintaining web applications and websites. I can design and develop websites and web software of varying complexities by hand, with web frameworks or with web editors.

This entire website is designed, developed and maintained by myself.

### Technologies

For backend, I have experience in the following:

- Rust programming language
  - [Actix](https://actix.rs/) - [ctclsite-rust](../projects/ctclsite/)
- Python programming language
  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - [ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/), [ToDoKiosk](../projects/todokiosk/), [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - [ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/) (2021-2022)

For frontend, I have experience in the following:

- Jinja2, Tera, Django HTML templating engines - [ctclsite-python and ctclsite-rust](../projects/ctclsite/), [ToDoKiosk](../projects/todokiosk/), [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)
- Plain HTML - ctclsite (no backend, 2020-2021)
- Plain CSS - [ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/) and former versions (2020-2023)
- SCSS/Sass - [ctclsite-python and ctclsite-rust](../projects/ctclsite/), [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)
- Bootstrap - [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)
- JavaScript - [ctclsite-python and ctclsite-rust](../projects/ctclsite/)
- jQuery - [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)

## Embedded Software
I have some experience in writing firmware for microcontroller-based devices and building custom embedded Linux images.

- C
  - Keypad controller for [MediaCow Touch "Nashville"](../projects/mct1/) - ARMv6-M
  - Various projects using Arduino hardware - AVR
- Rust 
  - Some experimentation with the Adafruit PyPortal - ARMv7E-M
- Python
  - Some experimentation with the Raspberry Pi Pico - ARMv6-M

## Other Software

### Game Design
With programming for games, I so far just have experience in creating mods with the C# programming language for games using Unity.

### Discord applications
I have experience in creating "bots" for the Discord messaging service using either pyCord or serenity-rs.

So far, this has been just [SLAG](../projects/slag/).
