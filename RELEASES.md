ctclsite-rust changelog

## 0.1.0
First release of the Rust version of the website

General changes:

- Rewritten entirely in Rust, mainly utilizing actix-web and Tera
- Smaller directory count
- Updates from GitHub, allowing for easier user contributions (pull requests)
- Blogs are easier to maintain
- ramlist.css and main.css merged
- Contact, About and Main pages merged

RAMList changes:

- Significant performance improvement due to using Rust over Python for the backend
- List pages are now themed the same color as the menu button
- Removed "Last Updated" due to the date changing every time the website is updated. This is temporary as I would look for a way to have the date more accurate.
